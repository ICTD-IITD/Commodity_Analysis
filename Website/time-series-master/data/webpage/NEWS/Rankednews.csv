Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget, said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata. She said due to the pandemic, sanitisers and masks have added to expenses on health.The retail inflation data for February showed the extent of the strengthening prices. Meat and fish prices rose an annual 11.3% in February, while egg prices shot up 11.1%. Oils and fats rose 20.8%, while pulses and products rose 12.5%. In fact, prices of mutton, which hovered at Rs 500 per kg pre-pandemic, nearly doubled during the lockdown and have remained Rs 750-800 per kg a year later.Price of tur dal, which was around Rs 95 per kg in Delhi in April last year, has now soared to Rs 108 per kg. It is a similar story for other pulses such as urad and moong in cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Edible oil prices have also hardened. Mustard oil, which was selling at Rs 114 per kg in Mumbai last year, is now available for Rs 155 per kg, while sunflower, which was at Rs 105 per kg in Kolkata, is now at Rs 179 per kg.Rising fuel costs have also added to the woes of households, although of late there has been some easing. The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother. He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year. Though most of the year he has worked from home. It has hit my monthly budget as savings have gone down. A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown, he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three. He continues to work from home for three days a week. Eating out has dropped substantially. He says his grocery, fruits and vegetables purchase costs have shot up not because of high prices but due to the buying of more quantity and exotic stuff. In education, there is a saving on childrens school uniform, transport and a marginal reduction in fees as extracurricular activities and field trips are not happening due to the pandemic. He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now. The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year. This is prominent in the case of food and non-food commodities. Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households. Consumption of vegetables and fruits suddenly shot up since the outbreak of the pandemic as we were forced to stay indoors. Now, we have decided to cut short on those expenses. Post-lockdown, we are now taking short breaks to entertain us, said Sumathi Jaykumar, a self-employed Chennai resident.",green gram dal,9,0.7797387107747569

But due to scarce rainfall in the last four months, the hopes of farmers were shattered as the crops got affected.Even after such plight, the farmers could not use machinery like water sprinklers which could have helped save the crops. Reason, lack of awareness on using such machinery and funds crunch. Only 4o of 2,198 farmers who had sown green gram in the district bought the sprinklers which were sold at a subsidised rate of `12,000 per unit by the Agriculture department.But the sprinklers too did not help as farmers alleged those stopped functioning within a couple of months. A farmer of Naugaon said the sprinkler he had bought stopped functioning within a couple of months due to which his crop on around 2.5 acre of land was spoiled.Sarat Chandra Nayak (65) of Sanpur village in Jagatsinghpur block said he does not recall facing such adverse conditions in the past. I had cultivated green gram on two acre of land and now it is tough to even recover the cost of seeds, he said. Sources said green gram crops have suffered considerable damage in Balikuda, Erasama, Tirtol, Kujang, Raghunathpur, Jagatsinghpur, Naugaon and Biridi blocks of the district.Chief district agriculture officer, Rabinarayan Mohapatra said if it does not rain in the next 5-7 days, more damage would be caused. He said the Agriculture department had spread awareness on use of sprinklers among farmers and since a few used the machine, the damage to the crop is significant this year.",green gram dal,9,0.7218965847406504

The state has recorded a deficit of 62 per cent in precipitation during March, preceded by a deficit of 80 per cent in February and 58 per cent in January. Water sources in Himachal have been drying up or running low, while shortage of rain has affected rabi crops in a state where around 80 per cent of the cultivated area is rainfed.The average yield of mustard crop in my land is one quintal, but it is not likely to exceed 8 to 10 kilogram this time. Similarly, the yield of barley will not be more than 10 to 15 per cent of the average. In case of wheat, the crop has not even developed sufficiently this time due to lack of rains, said Om Prakash Thakur, a resident of Dhami in Shimla district.According to IMDs meteorological centre at Shimla, Himachal received 41.7 millimetres of rain/snow in March against a long period average (LPA) of 110.9 mm. It was the second-largest rain deficit in the state during March in the last 10 years. The highest deficit of 67 per cent occurred in 2018, when state capital Shimla had suffered a severe water crisis in summer.This March, all 12 districts of Himachal witnessed deficiency or large deficiency in rain as per IMDs classification. Kangra, Hamirpur and Sirmaur were the most-affected, recording a deficit of 84, 79 and 77 per cent respectively, while Kullu (40 per cent), Mandi (40 per cent) and Shimla (41 per cent) recorded the least deficit.According to Pankaj Gupta, associate director of Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station at Mashobra, shortage of rain and snow this year has adversely affected temperate fruits such as apples, cherries and pears in their fruit set stage. The chilling requirements of these fruits could not be completed this winter due to lack of adequate snow and farmers have been demanding an official declaration of drought. Apples are now entering the flowering stage, but the flowering is neither expected to be profuse nor simultaneous. Plants are flowering in small patches which reduces pollination. What happens later during the fruit development stage remains to be seen, he said.",mustard oil,8,0.7400085743064467

(Representational Image)In the wake of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray indicating that a state-wide lockdown could be imminent to deal with rising cases of Covid-19, a section of farmers in the state have opposed such a move, pointing out the financial hardships it will entail. Farmers say they would face severe losses in sale of products such as milk, fruits and vegetables if markets close.While growers of non-perishable commodities like chana, tur and wheat might not face problems with disposal of their produce, a lockdown would result in huge losses to them. Last year, the nationwide lockdown in March had hit farmers hard, with many vegetable and fruit growers forced to throw away market-ready produce.Read | Maharashtra stares at lockdown as Covid-19 cases surgeSantosh Gorde, a grape and onion grower from the village of Takli Vinchur in Niphad taluka of Nashik district, urged the chief minister not to announce any such lockdown till April 15. The grape season is in its last leg and there should be no lockdown for at least the next 15 days. If the markets are closed, we will again be compelled to discard our produce, he said.Last year, Gorde and other grape farmers had sustained huge losses as the lockdown had dried up markets and prices had collapsed to Rs 10-12 per kg.

We will be operational with all the Covid-10 measures in place we cant afford another year of loss, he said.As talk of lockdown gains ground, traders from other states have stopped coming to Maharashtra to deal with farmers.

What are farmers supposed to do if the existing markets are closed, he asked.Farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti also spoke out against a lockdown, saying such a move will backfire on the economy. Other than fruits and vegetable growers, farmers who had invested in high-tech farming, like polyhouses or green houses, have also experienced heavy losses.Shetti said he has decided to meet state Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte on Tuesday to discuss the issue.",onion,7,0.7566622961017008

Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retail Traders Association, said, Ever since words started going around about a lockdown, the retailers are buying more stock of essentials and other products of use from wholesalers, fearing that a repeat of last year should not occur. People are also buying more than usual amounts of grocery items, so that they do not fall short of anything in the coming days.Nivangune said only grocery products and essentials were being bought in higher quantities. Other businesses, like clothes, cutlery and takeaway orders in restaurants, have been affected adversely during the past few days with a significant drop in sales. This is because most people are mostly spending on essential products, he said.Nivangune said all traders have unanimously opposed any lockdown in Maharashtra, adding that people were willing to cooperate with the government and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.Bharatlal Unecha, owner of a supermarket in Gokhalenagar said, Since the past two to three days, the customers have preponed their monthly shopping. Mamy people stocked up groceries for April by the end of March, instead of the usual period of first 10 days of a month.Another retailer in Model Colony said though the rush at grocery stores was not like last year when a lockdown had been announced, grocery sales have recently picked up with customers buying more due to apprehensions of such curbs.Apprehensions about another lockdown have already sparked a scramble for the vaccine. Experts said such apprehensions were likely to affect the vaccination numbers if the lockdown measures came into force and would undermine the huge efforts that have gone into boosting the inoculation numbers over the past three months.",rice,7,0.7313258855940815

Nevertheless, U.S. exporters continue to encounter significant tariff and non-tariff barriers that impede imports of U.S. products into India.According to the report, the US goods trade deficit with India was $23.8 billion in last year, a 1.7-per-cent increase ($389 million) over 2019. The goods exports to India were $27.4 billion, down 20.1 per cent ($6.9 billion) from the previous year. Imports from India were $51.2 billion, down 11.3 per cent.India was the US 12th largest goods export market in 2020.Exports of services to India were an estimated USD 24.3 billion in 2019 and imports were USD 29.7 billion. Sales of services in India by majority US-owned affiliates were USD 33.1 billion in 2018, while sales of services in the US by majority India-owned firms were USD 18.3 billion, the report said.US foreign direct investment in India (stock) was USD 45.9 billion in 2019, a 8.1 percent increase from 2018, it said, adding that the countrys direct investment in India was led by professional, scientific and technical services, manufacturing and wholesale trade.The annual report provides a detailed inventory of significant foreign barriers to US exports of goods and services, investment, and e-commerce.The first report of the Biden Administration said that since 2014, the Indian government promoted the Make in India campaign, a drive to build the countrys manufacturing capacity in part by cutting barriers to foreign investment and introducing regulatory reforms.As part of the campaign to encourage domestic production, India has raised duties on two broad groups  an assortment of labour-intensive products; and electronics and communication devices, including mobile phones, televisions, and associated parts and components, it said.The report alleged that Indias tariff regime was also characterised by large disparities between the World Trade Organization-bound rates and most-favoured-nation-applied rates.Indias WTO-bound tariff rate averaged 50.8 per cent, while its applied MFN tariff for 2019 averaged 17.6 per cent.Indias bound tariff rates on agricultural products are among the highest in the world, averaging 113.1 percent and ranging as high as 300 percent. Applied agricultural tariff rates are also high, averaging 38.8 percent, it said.While Indias applied tariff rates for certain agricultural products are lower, the rates still present a significant barrier to trade in agricultural goods and processed foods (e.g., poultry, potatoes, citrus, almonds, apples, grapes, canned peaches, chocolate, cookies, frozen French fries and other prepared foods used in quick-service restaurants).In addition, while India has bound all agricultural tariff lines in the WTO, nearly 30 percent of Indias non-agricultural tariffs remain unbound, the report said.",potato,7,0.6978124161309613

The Chief Minister ought to have acted earlier to check the renewed surge in casesthe BJP will vehemently oppose any decision that affects ordinary citizens, Mr. Darekar said.The BJP is seeking to exploit the alleged differences between the tripartite MVA as the spectre of an imminent lockdown looms large amid alarming case and fatality spikes across Maharashtra.Senior Congressmen like Prithviraj Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat, too, have expressed their disapproval over another lockdown while stressing that it must be carefully calibrated, and that relief must be provided to daily-wage earners in form of direct cash transfers.In a riposte to Mr. Darekar, Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut said that nobody ought to politicise the lockdown issue at the moment.I do not think that the decision to implement a lockdown or not ought to be a political hot potato. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi was compelled to impose a countrywide lockdown last year. There are times when governments do not have a choice but to take stern measures to preserve human life.

Although the extent of duty collected through a 2% levy will add up to around $55 million annually, the damage will be assessed by the USTR as part of the investigation. Experts believe it is bad optics considering that India the US are strategic allies but are yet to clinch a deal to sort out earlier action and retaliatory measures.The action came days after Catharine Tai was sworn in as the new USTR and had a virtual meeting with commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal . Last year, US had started a probe against India and several other countries for imposing DST.Exporters are cautious on their assessment. ""If the US goes ahead with the move, it will have a dampening effect on Indian exports. It is discriminatory tariff, especially when Indian exporters are competing with others for the same products. But the impact will depend on the extent of the duty imposed. If it is 2-3%, exporter may be able to absorb it. But it will sure hurt them if the tariff is 15-20%,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general of Federation of Indian Export Organisations .Others are seeking a multilateral solution to the issues, something that is being debated at international forums such as OECD. ""While Retaliatory tariffs can hamper the interests of SMEs and consumers both in India and US, a possible action by India will create a rollerball effect. Tax challenges in digital economies are not just limited to India but will involve many countries soon, and hence a multilateral approach by the way of dialogues should be considered,"" industry lobby group Trade Promotion Council of India said.The USTR move reiterates that countries do not change their policies despite the change of leadership, said trade experts.Given the tough bargain that US is known for, it is unlikely to settle for a deal without extracting concessions in return, especially when the finance ministry , which had imposed the levy, has failed to convince India's key trading partner on the issue.For the last two years or so, India is hoping to address US concerns, ranging from price control on medical devices IPR to e-commerce and export promotion schemes, while also negotiating a deal that will see both countries open up their markets for each other for products ranging from apple to technology products.",rice,6,0.6730892455771118

The rabi paddy procurement will start from May 1 and continue till June 30.Though 14.97 lakh farmers have registered online for sale of their surplus paddy under minimum support price (MSP), a report of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department said 11.92 lakh farmers sold their paddy till the deadline.The government failed to explain why 2.05 lakh registered farmers couldnt sell their produces. This points at the alleged irregularities in procurement process. The Food and Procurement Policy approved by the government said there was no bar on procurement of any higher quantum if more paddy comes to mandis from registered farmers.The fact remains that more mandis (3,840) were opened during this kharif season than last year (3,543) and 2,881 primary agriculture cooperative societies were engaged for procurement against 2,853 last year. Despite cash crunch, the Odisha Civil Supplies Corporation borrowed money from open market to buy paddy which costs around Rs 11,756 crore.",rice,5,0.7207418682512836

Farmers are being told that only persons who will get the message (from official web portal) can come to the mandis to sell their crops. Where will farmers go if they have already harvested their wheat and they havent got the message? Will he take his harvested crop to his home and then to the mandis? This will double his labour and transport costs. This process has been adopted by the government to harass the farmers. The government should immediately procure the crops being taken by farmers to the mandi, Hooda said.The Leader of Opposition also slammed the governments decision of reducing the moisture content in wheat from 14 to 12 per cent.Aim of this move is to avoid paying MSP and this is why government has decided to reduce the recommended amount of moisture. Also, earlier the permissible level for mixed quantity (rye, mustard, chaff, etc.) before weighing was 0.75 per cent in a quintal which has now been reduced to 0.50 per cent. This will cause heavy economic losses to the farmers. The government should immediately withdraw this decision, Hooda said.Referring to other issues including unemployment rate in Haryana, Hooda said, About 45,000 posts of teachers are lying vacant. In schools, about 50 per cent of the posts of headmasters and principal are lying vacant. According to a report, 54 per cent of the schools in the CMs district Karnal do not have head teachers. Nearly one lakh applicants who have passed HTET have been waiting for JBT recruitment for 7 years, but the BJP government in Haryana has not carried out a single recruitment in its term. Against this, more than 20,000 JBTs were recruited during the Congress term. It is clear that the government has made up its mind to hand over education completely in private hands.Hooda said if government does not recruit teachers, then number of children in schools will reduce further and this will be used as an excuse to close them. Recently, the government announced closure of 1,057 schools. Governments job is to build schools, not close them. Governments job is to provide affordable education to every child., he said, adding Haryana has once again topped the CMIE report with 28.1 per cent unemployment rate.",mustard oil,5,0.6947318704270927

It was very much possible with the increasing irrigation potential, assistance to farmers under Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima, 247 free power supply and other inputs.The increased extent of cultivation of crops during the last six years and increased rice supply by the State to Food Corporation of India (FCI) during the last six years were indicators of the status of agriculture sector in Telangana.

2021-04-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/palestinian-refugees-lebanon-covid-19-pandemic-7257515/,Palestinians in Lebanon: ‘The world has forgotten us’,"'Long live Palestine' is painted on a wall at the Burj Barajneh camp: Life for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is hard and getting harder. (DW/D. Hodali)Here in the camp, people dont stick that strictly to the coronavirus measures, says Kholoud Hussein as she shrugs her shoulders. There are just as many people out in our streets as there always are.Kholoud Hussein has lived her whole life in the Palestinian refugee camp Burj Barajneh in the south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. She works as an English translator and a project coordinator in a local womens organization. Until fairly recently, she had to go to the Haifa Hospital several days a week to translate for a team of doctors from the Japanese Red Cross, but since the start of the pandemic, the doctors havent been coming anymore. Now she works at home, translating studies and surveys.More to worry about than COVIDThe Haifa Hospital is located right in the heart of the camp. Kholoud is in close contact with the staff there. They tell me that they often have problems persuading the relatives of patients that they have to wear a mask when entering the hospital, she says. Kholoud always wears her mask, she says, because she doesnt want to be responsible for infecting anyone else.A lot of local organizations distribute free masks in the camp, she says. But according to Kholoud, not everyone here is convinced that they are of any use. What is more, she says, most people in the refugee camp have existential problems that far overshadow any worries about being infected by the coronavirus.A large proportion of the residents relies on food donations from organizations, with even milk now being a luxury item, Kholoud says. Her sister always liked making rice pudding, she adds, but that is no longer possible. The Lebanese economy was already in big trouble even before the pandemic. The Lebanese pound went down massively in value. And the devastating explosion in Beiruts port in August 2020 was the final straw.I get only 50% of my pay, she says. Her husband, her son and her stepson have all lost their jobs amid the economic crisis in Lebanon. Her daughter is still working. The two of us feed the family, she says.Financial problems at the UNRWAThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is responsible for the Palestinian refugees in the 12 official camps in Lebanon. This is because Lebanon does not accept any costs for the Palestinians.But the UN organization frequently becomes a pawn of political interests, as happened, for example, when former US President Donald Trump withdrew financing from the agency and made a dent in its finances to the tune of $300 million (255 million)  his successor, Joe Biden, has announced he will commence payments again. The main criticism leveled at the UNRWA is that by looking after 5.7 million Palestinians in the region, it creates incentives for them not to integrate in other Arab countries so that they remain permanent refugees instead.The background to this argument is the Palestinians right of return enshrined in the UN Resolution 194, which is one of the big issues in the quest for a resolution to the Middle East conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. While Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, for Palestinians, May 15 of that year marked the start of their flight and forced displacement to todays Palestinian territories and bordering countries, including Lebanon. However, what was initially considered to be a temporary solution for the Palestinians has now become a home for several generations. The UNRWA needs more than a billion US dollars each year to keep up its regular, emergency and lifesaving services.Erosion of rightsThe Palestinians in Lebanon have never been recognized by a Lebanese government as having equal rights. This is partly because the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was involved in fighting in the Lebanese Civil War, something that angered various political groups in the country. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugees pass on their refugee status to their children. They are not allowed to work in academic professions and are worse-paid than Lebanese with the same qualifications.The Lebanese side has always officially justified this exclusion with the argument that a complete integration of the refugees in Lebanon would make it harder for them to return home. So while the US, for example, would like to see the Palestinian refugees settle permanently in the country, Lebanon does not want them to.The Burj Barajneh camp was originally meant to house 3,500 people. But the UNRWA has officially registered 20,000 Palestinians in the camp, and, with the arrival of more refugees from war-torn Syria, the actual number of residents is believed to be twice as high as that.No room for quarantineThe lanes in the camp are narrow. Residents often cynically say that not even a coffin can get through them. Wherever you go, a tangle of telephone wires and uncovered electrical cables hangs above your head  residents regularly die from electrocution when it rains.Here in the camp, and in the houses, too, you cant really keep any distance, says Kholoud Hussein. Sometimes, as many as seven people share two rooms.Coronavirus testsMedical care is mostly provided by the UN aid agency. One day a week, the UNRWA, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the southern Lebanese Al Hamshari Hospital each carry out tests in the camp, which means there is testing on three to four days out of seven. That is quite well organized now, says Kholoud, recalling that it was not always that way: Particularly during the first days of the pandemic, she says, people had to pay a lot of money for tests in Lebanese hospitals  money that wasnt there.The coronavirus committee in the camp, which consists of NGOs and the Palestinian Red Cross, says that there were around 670 people in the camp infected by the coronavirus in February and March. But the unofficial number is likely to be higher, as not everyone takes a test.Anyone who becomes severely ill with COVID-19 is taken to the Al Hamshari Hospital. It is located near the city of Sidon, about 45 minutes drive to the south of Beirut. Kholoud has often worked as an interpreter there as well. A COVID ward has been set up at the hospital, partly paid for with money from Germanys Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Patients are transported there by ambulances.The UNRWA has also set up a quarantine center with 96 places for those people who have milder cases of the disease and are unable to isolate because of cramped living conditions. This so-called Medical Isolation Center is in Siblin.One of the people who went into quarantine there is Rayan Sokkar. She was infected by the coronavirus and was worried about passing it on to her family.This young Palestinian journalist was born and grew up in the Shatila refugee camp but now lives outside it. We were examined three times a day  mostly, they measured the oxygen level in our blood and our blood pressure or listened to our lungs with a stethoscope. We were well looked after.The coronavirus pandemic has put more financial pressure on the UNRWA. That is why its director, Philippe Lazzarini, does not tire of appealing to the international community for financial support. Unprecedented levels of despair with growing hunger & anger, he recently tweeted, adding that money was needed for food, the COVID response and dignified shelters.Kholoud Hussein has almost given up hope on this score. The world has forgotten us, she says. She doesnt expect much more from the international community. But at least she has a small reason to be pleased: She has already had her first coronavirus vaccination.",rice,5,0.6508308019845573

The Election Commission had passed the order restraining the government from distributing the rice on a complaint made by Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala. He had alleged that the distribution of subsidized rice and food would violate the model code of conduct.The court observed that the decision regarding the special distribution was taken on February 4, much before the election notification, and the government had taken auctions for the rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) worth 83.34 crores, and that the last date of payment for lifting the rice was March 31, 2021.The court also ordered that the distribution should be strictly done in accordance with the Model Code of Conduct which stipulated that the government should avoid all the ostentatious function and should not undertake welfare measures to influence the voters.When the petition came up for hearing, the Additional Advocate General submitted that the special rice distribution was intended for the Easter-Vishu-Ramzan festive seasons, and the decision in this regard was taken on February 4, 2021, well before the announcement of the poll. He pointed out that similar special distribution of rice through ration kits was done during the Onam festival in August last year as well.The Additional Advocate General also pointed out that the auction for lifting the rice from various depots of the FCI had already been completed. The model code of conduct did not apply to the ongoing programs.Counsel for the Election Commission submitted that the decision was taken to ensure the level playing ground for all the parties and that the ruling party did not take advantage of the special distribution in close proximity of the elections.The purpose of the model code of conduct was to prevent an undue advantage from being taken by the party in power by announcing welfare measures. It was also pointed out that the government did not say before the screening committee that it was a continuation of the progrmames in pursuant to a decision taken in February.",rice,5,0.6387286316593669

The court said the Finance Ministry failed to prove Yingluck was directly responsible for the financial losses.Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 coup, was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison in 2017 for negligence in instituting the subsidy program. She fled Thailand before the verdict and called the case politically motivated.The rice subsidy program was a flagship policy that helped Yinglucks Pheu Thai Party win the countrys 2011 general election. Under the program, the government paid farmers about 50 percent more than they would have received on the global market, with the intention of driving up prices by warehousing the grain.But other rice-producing countries captured the international rice market by selling at competitive prices. Thailand as a result lost its position as the worlds leading rice exporter and large amounts of rice sat unsold in government warehouses.Yinglucks critics described the overriding motive of the rice subsidy program as political  an effort to buy the loyalty of rural voters with state funds.Yingluck and her defenders said she was persecuted in an effort by political enemies to dismantle the political machine of her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled from power by a 2006 military coup after being accused of abuse of power, corruption and disrespect for the countrys monarchy.His supporters, who delivered him unprecedented electoral victories, believe his only offense was challenging the power of the countrys traditional elite, which is led by monarchists and the military and supported by the urban middle class.Yingluck and Thaksin remain in self-imposed exile.",rice,5,0.6238252622035542

Cool cool Trinamool, thanda thanda cool, vote paabe jora phool, she thundered, with an elan that TV advertising professionals would envy. Jora phool is the grass flower associated with the West Bengal Chief Ministers party, the Trinamool. Will it get the votes? Therein hangs a tale.Now, West Bengal may well be renamed Nandigram. You must of course overlook a few distractions like Amit Shah claiming a clean sweep, in arid Purulia. Or Mamata Banerjee actually demanding that the PMs visa and passport be cancelled for having visited Orakandi in Bangladesh. Those distractions are quite a handful for an Assembly election, you think? Yes. But then, this is West Bengal.A little detour: Orakandi is revered by the Matua community, quite a vital component of the voters in three Bengal districts. Nobody here, among the intelligentsia, quite likes the fact that the name of caste has been taken. Bengals politics has always avoided it. And thats the BJPs opening. Bengal still speaks a universal language. It still responds to resonating phrases like Amar Naam, Tomar Naam, Nandigram, Nandigram...Thats not just a slogan, by the way. Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, Burdwan, Birbhum, 24 Parganasdistricts which vote in the third and fourth phases or later seem somewhat indifferent about what happens to their own constituencies. But theyre not indifferent about Nandigram. Anywhere and everywhere, its difficult to get people focused on any other issue. The small talk all around the small tea shops, the small man walking back after his days work in those rich rice fields invariably focuses on that one thing.Its the Big Fight. The questions are: Is Didi panicking? Will Suvendu Adhikari pull it off ? Will Nandigram again be the turning point of Bengals political history? Its quite the local thriller. If you so much as mildly declare that you have been to the epicentre and have come out in one piece, you may very well get a discount at a sweet shop, or at Sonajuri haat, Santiniketan.Old stories form part of new narrativeWhat did you see there? Tell us, please. You can pay me later! Dulal Basak, with that incredulous look on his face, could be the face of the rest of Bengal. He has that look of having accidentally met an astronaut just back from the moon.Myths abound. That the Adhikaris virtually own Nandigram. That Didi is liberating it the second time over. Or just the opposite: that TMC atrocities have touched such heights that only the BJP can save the people. Nandigram, seven years since the violence against that old farmland acquisition felled even a Left government, is back haunting public memory.For all the contrary feelings that thought may evoke, its also influencing voting decisions across districts. Perhaps not even the voter knows where her finger may pass, such are the sentiments here. Its rich political drama.Even the long-forgotten Laxman Seth, the erstwhile CPI-M MLA, the villain of the piece in 2007, under whose watch the police firing took place in which over a dozen got killed in 2007, the man you could arguably blame for the Lefts near comatose state in Indiaeven he has come out of the woodwork. And hes not even contesting, but thats half the story.Now, Laxman Seth was called a harmand (goon) those days, maybe not without reason. And he was not heard of after a failed attempt to revive his political career in 2019, when he contested the Tamluk parliamentary seat on a Congress ticket. Congress? Yes. The CPI-M had expelled him in 2014, and he had then joined the BJP, before his compass shifted again. Tamluk is his old fort, the place where hed defeated Sisir Adhikari in 2004. No relation to Suvendu, you ask? Of course, hes the father, also old Congress stock, was MoS for rural development by the way under Manmohan Singh.Why are these old stories important? Because theyre part of the narrative in 2021. Its not so much party politics, as much as the underlying economic issues. Laxman Seth has been giving interviews. And been touching a chord with a rural Bengal that, contrarily, also wants industrialisation. A Bengal that doesnt want to go to Kerala and Bangalore just to have a job.All political parties are the same. When they first come to power, they make promises of a better system, but later the same bad elements come to rule the roost, says Ranjit Das, a voter in Bolpur constituency in Birbhum. He cites the Nandigram trajectory and draws parallels with the local politics in his constituency.This disillusionment is commonly heard in and around the Visva Bharati campus, perhaps even more keenly in the crafts markets adjacent to Santiniketan. The artisanal markets that dot the now burgeoning campus city may have only an ironic resemblance with things that Tagore said. The poet is mostly to be found caged in photo frames, sold at every street corner. He wanted the world to come to the country. In a way, the country wants the same.The elections themselves are a local Mahabharataa distraction, almost. Who has joined whom? Thats the talk everywhere. The protagonists of Nandigram or the general trend of TMC MLAs and other sundry heavyweights switching camps, thats what everyone talks about. This is the place that gave India Mir Jafar.If Purba Medinipurof which Nandigram is one of the 16 Assembly constituencies is seen as Adhikari turf, Birbhums 11 Assembly constituencies are considered a stronghold of the TMC. If Suvendu, and his father Sisir in particular, have a deep hold over that neck of the woods, Birbhum is the playfield of TMC district in charge Anubrata Mandal, a local toughie.The Adhikharis were perceived to be the last word in their bastion, while they were in TMC Mamata allowed their writ to run. (Its just coincidental that they happen to be on the other side now.) But that federal approach is true about Birbhum too, they say. Whether in Rampur, Siuri or Santiniketan, the refrain is that shes too indulgent of  Anubrata Mandal. In short, what the Adhikaris are or were to Nandigram, Mandal is to Birbhum. Not a leaf moves without him raising his finger, they say.Didis allegation that it was the Adhikaris who got the police in chappals into Nandigram in 2007 and thats what led to the mayhemfinds odd resonance here. Its almost a mythological narrative that gets repeated everywhere. Facts? They belong to another planet. Myths have a self-sustaining life of their own. There are stories about how many got killed, about dead children filled into sacks, about truckloads of dead bodies hidden under vegetables. The mass hysteria around has been reignited, in different ways.Didi allows Anubrata to manage this outpost in the same way, quips a Visva Bharati lecturer, who would rather not be named. The current V-C here, Bidyut Chakrabarty, makes no secret of his support to the BJP and the Prime Minister. Its fairly overt. But theres tangible tension on the ground. Its often, but not necessarily party-related.The young, for one, have no qualms at all. Deepak, a biotech student from the nearby Puralia, feels a change would be good for Bengalit would bring industry and jobs. We dont want to go out of the state to look for employment. Bengal should be an industrial leader again. We cant be doing artisanal work or cottage industry like our parents for all time. Theres no future in small scale, he says. Maybe Mahatma Gandhi should have been alive to hear his idea of paribartan.Birbhum is of course a TMC fortress, controlled by Mandal with an iron fist. Everyone agrees its impregnable. But local street cred is not the only factor. The CAA is an issue here, and it gives the TMC a fillip. Both the Hindus who migrated from then East Bengal and the original Muslim settlers here cite the Assam NRC fiasco. We may also be thrown out or our names may go missing! Most of us dont have old papers, says Subhas. Its not about religion here, as the national narrative goes, but about the precarity of life that all have faced equally.The students at Kalabhavan still have a whiff of Left idealism, and have their own story to tellone of resistance, and of standing to safeguard Bengals cultural ethos. Anirban Ganguly, the BJP Bolpur candidate, rubbishes those as wayward western thoughts. Tagore? Keep him to a side. Our central leaders have closely studied culture and thought process, claims Ganguly.Thats where the aspirational middle class is, even if theyre not big in numbers. One of them, an old neighbour of TMCs Anubrata Mandal, predicts that the BJP will get 4 out of 11 seats here, and three more after the elections are over!

The same agency and EVMs were good when it helped you to come to power in Bengal for 10 years, he said.Modi said he will come to West Bengal after May 2 (the counting day) to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the new Chief Minister who will be from the BJP.The two phases of phases of polling have sealed the outcome of the election. The more phases of the elections are held, the more Didi will get annoyed. Didi, you are facing defeat. It is time to accept. Election khela noy (not a game). Democracy khela noy. Didir khela sesh hobe (Didis game will come to an end), he said.I will tell the new Chief Minister that I will send money from Delhi. Please use them as soon as possible. I will also ensure that farmers get their arrears which Didi stopped. Every farmer will get Rs 18,000 in his account before Durga Puja, he added.The PM continued, Didi, you must trust the people of Bengal. They have said that you will have to leave Nabanna (state secretariat) with your Taka Maar Company (TMC).Talking about Singur which had seen Tata Motors shifting its Nano plant to Gujarat from there, Modi said, TMC cheated the people of Singur with its anti-land acquisition movement. Today, people in Singur are directionless. There is no industry in Hooghly which was once known as industrial belt. Farmers dont have cold storage to keep their produce especially potatoes. They are fed up with the syndicate raj which has flourished under the TMC.Referring to Banerjees claims that those who attend BJP rallies are paid to do so, Modi said: Stop insulting the people of Bengal by saying they are being paid to attend our rallies. People of Bengal are self-respecting people. They cannot be bought.Later, at a rally in Sonarpur in South 24 Parganas, Modi said Banerjee has conceded defeat from Nandigram and is planning to contest 2024 Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi.After sensing her defeat from Nandigram, the TMC decided to field Didi in two seats. Now they are talking about Mamata Didi fighting Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi. This proves that Didi has conceded her defeat in Bengal and is looking for a place outside the state, said Modi.Ridiculing Banerjee, the PM added, There (Varanasi) you will get to see a lot of chotiwala and tilak sporting people. You will also get to hear Har har Mahadev along with Jai Shri Ram. I will advise you that dont get angry with UP people and Varanasi people. They have given me a lot of love and they will also give you a lot of respect. They will not call you an outsider or a tourist or tourist gang.On Thursday, Modi, at a rally, had asked if Banerjee was filing her nomination from a second seat. In response, TMC MP Derek OBrien asserted that she would win Nandigram and not contest from any other seat. TMC MP Mahua Moitra said Banerjee will contest from Varanasi which is PM Modis Lok Sabha constituency and advised him to get his armour on.",potato,4,0.6755952079287576

Asha issued the stay order on a petition moved by the State government challenging the order of the Commission.The court also made it clear that that the distribution of rice should be made strictly in accordance with the clauses of the Model Code of Conduct which required the government to avoid all ostentatious functions and not to create an impression that such welfare measures were being undertaken to influence the electors in favour of the party in power.Govt. standThe State government submitted that the Model Code of Conduct did not apply to the ongoing programmes. The decision regarding the special distribution of rice was taken on February 4, much before the issue of the election notification.The decision to give additional rice of 10 kg at of 15 per kg to 50 lakh families who hold blue and white ration cards was based on the budgetary allocation. It was ordered to be provided in March and April in view of the forthcoming Vishnu-Easter-Ramadan festive season.The government pointed out that it had successfully obtained an auction acceptance offer for rice worth 84 crores from the the Food Corporation of India (FCI). If the auctioned lot was not lifted by that date, the rice would be re-appropriated by the FCI, and the State would have to participate in fresh auction, which might entail an additional burden on the the government.The EC's directive to defer the distribution till the election was over would adversely affect at least 50 lakh families, thereby impinging on the fundamental right guaranteed to them under Article 21 of the Constitution.Need of the hourIn fact, a social welfare measure such as distribution of rice was the need of the hour in this pandemic situation in view of the fast approaching Vishu  Easter and Ramadan festival seasons. If all the Election Commission was worried about the opposition from some political party, it is also trite that such political opposition alone was not a material factor, the government added.The Election Commissions counsel submitted that the order directing to defer the distribution of rice was based on a decision of a screening committee consisting of the Chief Secretary and other secretaries constituted to streamline the grant of permissions in view of the Model Code of Conduct.The purpose of such a committee was to expedite the grant of permission in the light of the code of conduct. The proposal of the government placed before the committee did not disclose that the distribution was being undertaken as part of its earlier decision taken prior to the announcement of the polls.",rice,4,0.6525183271200788

The growing rift comes as the United States and other Western governments increase pressure on China over suspected human rights abuses in the western region.Chinese social media users last week began circulating a 2020 statement by H&M announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang.H&M said at the time the decision was due to difficulties conducting credible due diligence in the region and after media and human rights' groups reported the use of forced labour in Xinjiang - a charge that Beijing has repeatedly denied.Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the regional government of Xinjiang, told reporters that a company should not politicise its economic behaviour and said H&M won't be able to make money anymore in the Chinese market because of its statement.Elijan Anayat, another Xinjiang government spokesman, said during the briefing that Chinese people do not want the products of companies such as H&M and Nike that have boycotted Xinjiang's cotton. He invited companies to take trips to the region's cotton fields to see for themselves what is happening.WESTERN SANCTIONSWashington on Friday condemned what it called a ""state-led"" social media campaign in China against US and other international companies for committing not to use cotton from Xinjiang.The wave of consumer boycotts in China has coincided with a coordinated set of sanctions imposed by Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States last week over what they say are human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. The US government has publicly accused Beijing of genocide against the Uighur Muslim ethnic minorities in the region.Xu repeatedly rejected accusations of genocide and human rights abuses in the region and accused the Western powers of engaging in political manipulation to destabilise China with the sanctions.The United States in January announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from the area due to allegations of forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims .Western governments and rights groups have previously accused authorities in the far-western region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.China has repeatedly denied all such charges and say the camps are for vocational training and combating religious extremism.",tomato,4,0.6449514683773974

Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, APERC Chairman Justice CV Nagarjuna Reddy said the average unit price has been brought down to Rs 6.37 from Rs 7.17.He said three Discoms projected a combined deficit of Rs 11,741.18 crore at the proposed tariff with hike in tariff for certain categories of consumers and Rural Electric Supply Cooperatives (RESCOs). The APERC has fixed a deficit of Rs 7,433.80 crore for the three Discoms thus avoiding a burden of Rs 4,307.38 crore on consumers.The Average Cost of Service (ACoS) has been reduced from Rs 7.17 to Rs 6.37 per unit as per the APERC approvals. The State government has agreed to bear a subsidy burden of Rs 7,297.08 crore pertaining to agriculture consumers eligible for free supply of power and dhobi ghats for the financial year 2021-22.In order to maintain uniform tariff across the State, the government has also agreed to bear a subsidy of Rs 136.72 crore arising due to concessional tariff extended to domestic consumers of APEPDCL, he said.The APERC had accepted the proposal of Discoms to collect Rs 10 per kW a month from domestic consumers in lieu of minimum charges. The decision will benefit all the domestic consumers who do not consume energy in any given month on the one side and generate a moderate additional revenue to the Discoms from the consumers who consume energy on the other side, he said.Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said they rejected the proposal of Discoms to bill apartment consumers under a single point HT connection as it will create problems for the middle class apartment dwellers.The proposal to remove fixed charges (Rs 100/kW/month) for function halls was accepted. The proposal to change the present peak Time of Day (6 am to 10 am) to 4 am to 8 am was rejected as it will effectively reduce off peak time by 2 hours for industries, he said.Existing rice mills and pulverisers are given one more opportunity to avail the benefit of getting billed under LT tariff up to a connected load of 150 HP against the present limit of 100 HP, the APERC Chairman said.Average unit price reduced to Rs 6.37 from Rs 7.17The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission has fixed a deficit of Rs 7,433.80 crore for the three Discoms in the State thus avoiding a burden of Rs 4,307.38 crore on power consumers.

The research paper has been authored by NIOH scientists Bidisa Sarkar and Paramita Sengupta. People with low Ct value have high viral load and vice versa. Hence, Ct value of initial viral load of already diagnosed cases mandatorily be mentioned in each individual report for further management.Individuals with high viral load are super-spreaders - they take the centre stage in person to person transmissions of coronavirus. This appears to be true as similar observations (few people spread most and most people spread few) were also made during severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemics, claims the paper.The paper states that in case of Covid-19 a 10% of all those infected with Covid-19 are responsible for spreading 80% of all local transmissions.The paper points to drop in cases achieved after Ct-based strategy was followed by Ahmedabad district administration since third week of June where cycle threshold-based segregation of laboratory-confirmed positive cases was adopted for home quarantine, institutional quarantine and hospitalization based on symptomatology. Apart from Ct-based segregation the scientists also pointed out that Contact tracing of the previous five days of the cases with higher viral load is to be done rigidly considering as transmission starts on an average four to five days prior to first appearance of symptoms.",tomato,4,0.639643374013747

On both occasions, the then oppositions found fault with the governments undue haste in distributing freebies to voters ahead of election.In 2011, V S Achuthanandan government announced rice at Rs 2 per kg for all ration card holders without APL/BPL distinction. The decision was taken in the cabinet meeting held on February 23, 2011, which was the last full-fledged meeting held before the notification of the assembly election. In fact, the government issued hasty orders to ensure that the distribution of subsidised rice wouldnt be hit by the model code of conduct.However, the election commission vetoed the decision after the then opposition leader Oommen Chandy raised a flag against the intention of the government. The commissions order was challenged in the High Court by CPI leader and then MLA Rajaji Mathew Thomas.The division bench led by Justice J Chelameswar quashed the EC order and allowed the government to implement the scheme, by noting that the decision and other steps for implementing the scheme were taken before March 1, 2011, when the model code of conduct came into effect.In 2016, the election commission found fault with the Oommen Chandy governments decision to provide free rice to all BPL families in the state. The decision was announced in the budget that year and also necessary orders were issued before the model code of conduct came into force. However, the then chief electoral officer E K Majhi told the government that the scheme couldnt be launched as a new scheme as notification for election has been issued.The government then forwarded all files to the commission and decided to approach the High Court against the order. On the eve of going to the court, the commission cleared the proposal after receiving legal advice that the 2011 order by Justice J Chelameswar was binding for this decision too. The commission had laid out several strictures including not adding any new beneficiary to the scheme or not advertising the scheme as an achievement of the government during the campaign while clearing the proposal. Interestingly, the then CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was supportive of the ECs decision.Oommen Chandy is intolerant to the Election Commission. His government would be known as the first to take on the Election Commission which only questioned its wrongdoings, Pinarayi had said during an election campaign meeting in Kozhikode then.As his role reversed to the chief minister, Pinarayi is now finding fault with Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, alleging a bid by him to stop the distribution of food to the needy. In 2011, V S Achuthanandan sought a public apology from Oommen Chandy after the High Court cleared the Rs 2 rice scheme for trying to sabotage the scheme.Along with the distribution of free rice under the noon-meal scheme to schoolchildren, the LDF Government has made all arrangements to finish the distribution of the Ramzan-Vishu free grocery kit before April 6, the polling day. The decision to start distribution in the last week of March, which was now changed to April 1, was to ensure that maximum number of families would receive the kit before D-Day. Arrangements were also made to provide two months social welfare pension of Rs 3,100  including Rs 1,500 for March and the revised Rs 1,600 for April - to nearly 50 lakh beneficiaries. For streamlining the fund flow, Finance Minister Thomas Isaac convened a meeting of the Finance Department and Treasury officials on March 19.The state has borrowed Rs 8,000 crore by auctioning bonds this month for facilitating the smooth distribution of all welfare schemes. The additional revenue in the states coffers will also help it provide revised pay for government employees and revised pension for state government employees in the first week of April itself. The March-19 meeting convened by Isaac had also decided to make Good Friday and Easter as working days for treasuries so that salary and pension are distributed before the polling day.

These will be the last kits from the current ruling dispensation. Speaking to TNIE, a senior officer in the Commissionerate of Civil Supplies said, The welfare kit distribution for the month of April will start on Tuesday and the exercise is expected to be completed by this weekend, he said.Whether politics over the kits has helped the ruling dispensation politically or not, the distribution was one of the mammoth special drives carried out by the department that evoked huge public interest. On average, 84 lakh families bought the kits distributed by the government through ration shops every month from April 2020.In the beginning, it was the survival kit during lockdown, which was followed by the Onam kit, and then the welfare kit in the following months. If 18 types of grocery worth Rs 1,000 were in each survival kit, the welfare kit had around 10 items worth Rs 500. The last kit will have 14 items due to Easter and Vishu festivals and it will mark the end of the year-long kit distribution.The kit also courted controversy during Onam after jaggery and pappad distributed through the kits were found to be of inferior quality. Later, the companies which supplied the groceries had to face legal issues and fine. The state had spent around Rs 4,198 crore for the distribution of kits, including money from the Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund. It was widely acknowledged that the kits distributed by the LDF government helped the front romp home during the last local body elections following which the government decided to extend the kit distribution till April 2021.The government had made arrangements also to distribute special rice to non-priority ration card-holders (blue and white cards), but it was halted by the Election Commission following a complaint by the Opposition leader stating that it was in violation of the model code of conduct.

India is fast catching up with the western world in millet consumption, said N. Murugan, CEO, Southern Health Foods, makers of the Manna brand of foods. Excerpts:Millet-based products are fast gaining acceptance in the West. How is the scenario in India?India, Nigeria and China are the largest producers of millets in the world, accounting for more than 55% of the global production. For many years, India was a major producer of millets.However, in recent years, millet production has increased dramatically in Africa. In India, pearl millet is the fourth-most widely cultivated food crop after rice, wheat and maize. It occupies an area of 6.93 million hectare with an average production of 8.61 million tonnes and productivity of 1,243 kg/ha during 2018-19.Why is India slow in adopting millet-based products?Millets are available almost across India. They need very little water for growing.The awareness of the benefits of millets is still low and this is the reason for lesser number of players working on value-added millet products in India.However, we see this increasing in the coming years as many States will start supporting millet cultivation both on account of the benefits and the fact that they need less water.So, we see a slow expansion of millet-based products in the next few years and a big explosion in these products after that.Why are many firms not keen on entering this sector?There are only a handful of players in the branded and/or in the organised sector at the moment. However, it is going to change in the next 12 to 24 months.How does Southern Health Foods fit into this?We want to make many foods and beverages more nutritious for consumers through millets and multi-grains. Most of our products have a high percentage of millets in them.In a country such as India where there is a high incidence of diabetes, millets, being complex carbohydrates with low GI [glycemic index], are indeed wonder grains and [hence] we see a huge relevance in shifting consumers to millets and millet-based products.We will communicate the same to consumers through the media.We want to be one of the pioneers in leading the countrys millet revolution that, we are sure, will happen soon.Your growth strategy?Ours is a food and beverage company that wants to make consumers healthier by increasing the nutrition content in food intake.Apart from having health products, the company is looking to expand its portfolio through relevant innovations in the health-food space. Products under Manna, our Made-in-India brand, are also exported to countries around the world.We will keep researching and formulating new millet-based food products that will help in improving the nutrition quotient of what consumers eat everyday.So, innovation, consumer awareness and engagement are the cornerstones of the strategy. Our aim is to introduce at least one new product every quarter.What is your target for the next two years?Our goal is to improve the share of millet and millet- based value-added products in our portfolio from the present 60% to 80%, double the number of products and distribution channels and increase distributors by 30%. The share of e-commerce is about 8% and this is set to increase.On the pandemics impact on your operations...?Our sales did not drop as 80-90% of our volume came through sales of health-mix products. Currently, we operate our units at 70% to 80% of capacity in a single shift and this will increase with an increase in demand.The lower demand also means limited supply and higher prices. This will change as more consumers start trying out millets and value-add millet products.",rice,3,0.6872557158931545

She is 'Nation's Didi' Mamata Banerjee.She became the chief minister of West Bengal in 2011 by ending the 34-year-long CPI(M) regime, one of the longest-serving elected governments in the world. Now after ruling the state for two successive terms, the 2021 poll battle is surely not a cakewalk for her. It is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that trespassed her dominion after gaining overwhelming results from the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. And, the emergence of the Left-Congress-ISF alliance has made the situation more complicated for her.Banerjee endorses her governance as the rule of three 'M's, that is, 'Maa', 'Mati' and 'Manush' (mother, soil and people). But, the Bengal elections have another 3M factor this time, that is, 'Mamata', 'Modi' and 'Muslim'. So, Banerjee's challenge is to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity in Bengal at one side and regain her support base of the minority community that might step out with the Left-Congress-ISF alliance.Now making the battle of power more interesting, Mamata has chosen Nandigram over her home turf Bhabanipur seat this time to test her fate in the 2021 elections. It was the agitation in Nandigram and Singur against the Left government's land acquisition policies that made Mamata Banerjee the Chief Minister of West Bengal.Now not just Bengal, but the country's eye is on Nandigram that will witness the most high-profile contest on April 1 with the chief minister taking on her former ministerial colleague Suvendu Adhikari, who had joined the BJP in December last year.Further, Banerjee's poll campaign this time got a new dimension with a wheelchair after she suffered an injury earlier this month while campaigning in Nandigram.Not to mention, the West Bengal Chief Minister spared no poll stage to launch scathing attacks on Prime Minister Modi. However, the Modi-Mamata battle was quite visible even before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. She played an instrumental role in bringing together all opposition parties against the Centre prior to the 2019 general elections. The seventh-term MP also has been among the first key figures who heavily criticised the central government in issues starting from demonetisation to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and lockdown to fuel prices. Her fighting spirit and mass appeal have made her one the tallest opposition figures in the current political arena.Mamata Banerjee started her political career as a Youth Congress worker in the 1970s. She quickly rose the ranks and became the general secretary of Mahila Congress and later All India Youth Congress. In 1984 she was elected as a member of parliament in the 8th Lok Sabha becoming one of India's youngest parliamentarians. She founded the All India Trinamool Congress in 1997 after a disagreement with Congress.Mamata Banerjee worked with three Prime Ministers including PV Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Dr Manmohan Singh. She had been a Union Minister in both National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments and held portfolios like Human Resource Development, Youth Affairs and Sports, Women and Child Development, Coal and Mines and the Railways. Notably, she was the first woman to become a railway minister in the country. The Time Magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.Hailing from a lower-middle-class family, Mamata Banerjee worked as a milk booth vendor to battle poverty. Her father passed away due to the lack of treatment when she was just 17. The fighter in her never let the barriers dominate her. She continued her education and earned a Bachelor's degree in History, a Master's degree in Islamic History and degrees in Education and Law from the University of Calcutta. She also worked as a stenographer and a private tutor before joining full-time politics.Another disposition of Mamata Banerjee is her minimalist lifestyle. Despite being the Chief Minister, she still lives in her ancestral terracotta-tiled roof house at Kolkata's Harish Chatterjee Street. White cotton sarees having mono-colour borders and slippers are all that define the fashion statement of Mamata Banerjee.The West Bengal Chief Minister is also a self-taught painter, poet and writer. She has authored more than 100 books. She is also tech-savvy and remains active on social media. The Trinamool Supremo is also known for her walkathons or marches. Here it needs to be mentioned that she walks five-six kilometres on a treadmill every day. When it comes to evening snack time, she likes to have tea, puffed rice and 'aloo chop'.The second phase of the West Bengal Assembly polls is scheduled for April 1. In phase-II, 30 seats covering a segment of South 24 Parganas, Bankura, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur will go to polls to decide the fate of 171 candidates including 19 women.Meanwhile, the first phase of the West Bengal Assembly elections concluded with an estimated 79.79 per cent voter turnout on Saturday.In the first phase, 30 seats covering all Assembly constituencies from the districts of Purulia and Jhargram and a segment of Bankura, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur went to polls.",rice,3,0.6796678051493917

That is why Trell creator Nandu Ramisetty has some super cool ways to help you make organic colours at home.She says she starts with putting 1/4th cup of water in a bowl for making one colour at a time. I put 2-3 drops of food colour in it of my choice. Adding 4-5 spoons of cornstarch to the water, mix it well immediately. Pour the liquid on a plastic sheet and leave it to dry for 15 minutes to an hour.

So while your first priority for Holi should be to find safe, organic colours- like those derived from flowers-you can also reverse the effects of chemical colours on your skin through organic products. If you spent the later part of the Holi festival in rubbing off the colours from your skin but they are still around, we feel you.We got in touch with Radhika Iyer Talati, Founder of Beauty By Anahata, to share some DIY recipes that can help you give yourself healthy skin post Holi.1. On the day post Holi, massage your body and face with any natural oil, such as coconut, sesame-wheat germ, grapeseed oil or rose-almond oil. This will prevent the colours from entering your pores and sticking to your skin. On the hair add castor oil or coconut oil.2. Wipe your face, hands and feet with a mix of natural micellar water. This is often used to remove makeup as well, and there are some amazing organic brands manufacturing this product. This will ensure that the colours dont stick between your fingers and toes, and will stubborn stains on the nails.3. Use any ubtan powder to scrub your body and face. You could also make this powder at home by crushing together moong, turmeric, edible camphor, rose powder, rice, chandanam powder and orange peel. This will not only remove unwanted colour but will also remove dead skin, soften the skin and nourish it. Apply this 30 minutes before shower, scrub gently.4. For the face, use rose water (after using ubtan) to nourish the skin. Incase of stubborn colour in the eyebrows, use lemon juice mixed with wheat flour to bleach the colors off- dont rub, gently dab this.5. Use a mix of coconut milk and curd in the hair. Apply and leave it in the hair for 45 minutes to naturally condition the hair and remove the dryness of the colours. Alternatively, an organic hair scrub of neem, shikakai, tulsi, ashwagandha and other herbs would do wonders to restore natural and healthy hair.",rice,3,0.6737404031293788

After the Congress passed the Quit India resolution on August 8, 1942, 10,000 people marched to the Nandigram police station on September 30, 1942, to hoist the Tricolour there.The British troops fired at them, killing eight. Dictionary of Martyrs Indias Freedom Struggle (1857-1947) Vol 4, published by the ministry of culture and the Indian Council of Historical Research, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 7, 2019, mentioned the eight martyrs, including Sheikh Alauddin (40), who was actively participating in the Quit India movement. Ajim Baksh and Sheikh Abdul, who were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, died in Midnapore jail.Tamluk, along with adjoining areas, were the only pocket in the entire country to gain independence from the British twice  once after the Quit India movement and again, on August 15, 1947, said Raj Sekhar Basu, historian and professor of modern Indian history, caste movement and history of medicine at Calcutta University.The undivided Midnapore, then a Congress stronghold, witnessed mass mobilisation during Civil Disobedience Movement in the early 1930s and Union Board Boycott Movement in early 1920s. The movements continued there for almost five years even after it lost steam in other parts of the country. This is because the leaders there hailed from the grassroots. The working class was suffering due to several restrictions, like free movement of boats and people that impacted residents livelihoods, said Basu.Now, parties were attempting to divide the people of Nandigram on religious lines to gain votes, experts said. Nandigram has always been a hub of cultivation of rice and vegetables, which explains the high population of Muslims there. Some Muslims are also weavers by profession. Nandigram is also a centre of Baishnabs. When the police entered Nandigram in March 2007, there were special azaans from the mosques and prayers by Baishnabs. The farmers, irrespective of their religions, have always been united in Nandigram. It is sad to see that people are trying to vitiate the atmosphere for petty gains, said Jharna Panda, a professor hailing from Nandigram.",rice,3,0.667910750476545

We do not know if there will be another pandemic.""In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily, Krupp said this will require some level of state aid, and that the government is considering a vaccine production reserve of 500 million doses per quarter, or about 2 billion a year.",rice,3,0.6573880298732155

Surendran told reporters here on Wednesday that Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala was hesitant to ask where the rice in the kit came from. Both Chennithala and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan do not want to acknowledge that the rice was provided by the Narendra Modi government.The BJP president also alleged widespread irregularities in postal voting in the state. Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are seen participating in LDF rallies. These BLOs collect postal votes by taking CPM workers along with them and without informing representatives of other parties, he alleged.Nobody can say for sure where these postal votes will end up. In Konni, polling officers, who went to collect postal votes, were accompanied by CPM workers carrying food kits, he said.Widespread malpractices in postal voting was one of the reasons for BJP losing many seats in Thiruvananthapuram corporation by a whisker, Surendran said.Jose silencedSurendran said Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K Mani, who voiced concerns about Christian girls falling prey to love jihad, was quickly silenced by Pinarayi and CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran. The concerns over love jihad were not voiced by Hindu Aikyavedi alone, but also by various Christian groups, he pointed out.The BJP leader also hit out at Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan for allegedly misusing the powers of the legislature to start business venture in the Middle East.

That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours.It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. Id had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce.The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more.Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours  such as cilantro  are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat  think corn on the cob or peanuts  came to our shores from distant Mexico.I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions.The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn  soft inside and crunchy outside  had soaked in the flavours.The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (625) was just that  hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didnt really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce.The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese.Churros with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce at Miss Margarita in Delhi | Photo Credit: Special arrangementChef Barnes takes pride in his Fresh Guacamole Bar, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too.There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (775).I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (425). It is a simple dish  fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.The writer is a seasoned food critic",onion,2,0.7554625159995845

That was not all. Since my mother, Thelma Gomez, hails from St. Andrews near Menamkulam in the capital city, she also used to make sweet hot cross buns, rich in spices like nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and all-spice powder. St Andrews had a unique culture with traces of Portuguese influence and so she used to bake the hot cross buns for Easter. My paternal grandmother, Lydia Gomez, was the one who made the Indri appam (or Pesaha appam) and kurukku, which is also called pesaha paal, says Marina, a popular cookery instructor and blogger settled in Bengaluru.Myriad optionsAs with all things food, each region and Christian denomination in Kerala has its own flavours for Lent. What is common is the simple food that is usually served on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday after the church service is over. While it is invariably kanji (rice porridge) and payar (green mung) on Good Friday, on Maundy Thursday it is the Pesaha appam, an unleavened bread made of rice flour that is cooked in many Christian households all over Kerala.Pesaha appam or kurishappam | Photo Credit: Ammu Elizabeth JohnLent is a period of fasting, prayers and abstinence for many Christian families. Although Easter eggs and bunnies are getting increasingly popular, many families continue the tradition of making or buying Pesaha appams. Although we make Easter eggs, cakes and hot cross buns, what is much in demand is the Indri appam that is served on the day of Maundy Thursday, says Reina Thomas, one of the partners of Square One Homemade Treats, a popular bakery in Thiruvananthapuram.Marina says that since cakes are easier to make, many of the ethnic snacks that were traditionally made during the Holy Week have been forgotten as they involve a great deal of time consuming, laborious stirring and cooking, mostly with rice flour. To keep the tradition going, Marina makes it a point to make the Indri appam every year.Traditional treats St. Michels Bakery, Bread Fort, Ambrosia and Square One Home Treats make the hot cross buns that many of us are familiar with because of the popular nursery rhyme about it. Michel David, proprietor of St. Michels Bakery, makes both hot cross buns and hot cross bread. He says there is a clientle for it as some families have the buns or the bread with milk on Maundy Thursday. It is available on Wednesday and Thursday at the different outlets of the bakery.Prasobhithan S says Bread Fort will also be making about 20 to 25 hot cross buns and different kinds of breads for Maundy Thursday. As Square One Homemade Treats will be closed from Thursday for Easter, their hot cross buns and pesaha appam will be available on Wednesday.Preethi Abraham, a home cook, recalls that during her childhood in Ranni, Pathanamthitta, the service on Maundy Thursday used to be early in the morning at around 3 am. The Indri appam, made with rice flour and urad dal, was steamed, either in leaves like an ela ada or in a vessel. The Cross that we got for Palm Sunday is pressed into the middle. In the evening, after prayers, the eldest in the family would bless the appam, cut it and serve it to the others for dinner. It is dipped into a syrup that we called kuruma, also called paal in some places. The paal is made with jaggery and coconut milk, says Preethi. Nowadays, Preethi cooks the paal and a friend of hers makes the appam and they share it.Wayanad-based Babu Stephen, son of YouTuber Annamma Pulivelil aka Annamma chedathi (Annammachedathi Special) explains that in their parish, the Indri appam is steamed in banana leaves while the Pesaha appam is called Kurishu appam as it has the palm leaf cross embedded in the middle.Pesaha appam (unleavened bread) and paal are made on Maundy Thursday in many Christian homes in Kerala | Photo Credit: Bindu JoyTraditions prevailAll my siblings, and our children gather at our house since my mother stays with us. After prayers, it is the kurishu appam, made with a little sugar, that is cut by the eldest in the family and shared amongst all of us. Usually, after the service, this sharing of food was done in the church. This time, in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol, all of us in our parish have been told to conduct the prayers at home after the service, says Babu.Hot cross buns | Photo Credit: PexelsIn many homes in Kollam, the dough, made of rice flour, coconut and jaggery, is filled in vayana leaves (bay leaves) folded into cones and steamed, says Jessie Ignatius, a former school teacher from Kollam. However, my mother in Thrissur used to make pulikatha appam (unfermented appam) made without yeast. It is made with rice, urad dal, shallots and coconut and made as soon as the mixture was ground. My mother used to make the kurukku with rice powder, coconut milk, jaggery, a bit of ghee and roasted cumin. I used to love the flavour of the cumin in the kurukku, she says.Marina says that some people might add a bit of jaggery to the Pesaha appam and that gives it a brownish tone. And the paal could be seasoned with cardamom too. Kalathappam, a bread made in a pot, is also made on Maundy Thursday by some families. Made of rice flour and lightly spiced, there were fried shallots and coconut in it, she says.The flavouring agents and the names might differ but not the solemnity of the occasion when families break bread together for Maundy Thursday, symbolising the Last Supper of Jesus Christ.Recipe of Pesaha AppamIngredientsRice powder: 1 cupUrad dal: 3 table spoonCoconut grated: 1 cupGarlic: 1Small onion: 2Jeera: a pinchWater: 1 to 1 cupsMethodSoak urad dal for 30 minutes and grind it into a smooth paste by adding little water.

From understanding the schedule of the IT employees in the vicinity to comprehending the psyche of their guests, they have done a host of things to stay relevant. Hotel Ibis Hyderabad at Hi-Tec City, opened its alfresco to host the Grills and Tandoor Weekend nights a month ago. Says General Manager Venu Gopal, We started this tentatively, but once our guests started coming, we decided it was time to go all out to line up some delicacies including haleem and other things that our local and outstation guests love. Many, who have stayed indoors for over a year, have started stepping out, albeit with their masks and following Covid protocols.A conversation with a guest made us host pets too recently. In March this year, Ibis Hyderabad opened its doors to pets. They invited pet owners to spend a staycation with them and on offer were special bowls, mattresses, exclusive entrance for them and their pets, a place earmarked for the pets to answer natural calls and even a vet on call. With travel again on getting clamped with increase in Covid cases, there have been enquiries for relaxed staycations and we have started offering our rooms for really affordable prices, says Venu Gopal. Interestingly, there are guests who plan their shopping at IKEA and then club it with a stay in the hotel and going back home on Sunday with their shopping haul.Executive Chef Namala Arun Kumar adds that he has planned what he calls a ghar ka khana platter for guests who could not travel to their hometown in other states are missing home.

However, it doesnt have to be that complicated, said Ishani Vellodi Reddy, wellness entrepreneur and founder  Ishani Vellodi Wellness.A few simple strategies will help to improve your health and also feel sharper than ever  with just a tiny bit of effort through the course of your day, she told indianexpress.com.Below, she suggests a few simple tips to do just that. Take a look:ALSO READ | Wheat or millet: Which roti should you have?Include 1-2 servings of whole grains in your diet each dayDont let all the anti-carbohydrate talk fool you; your body needs carbs, she said. Theyre a primary energy source for your organs, essential for hormone stability, to foster good gut health, and can help prevent cravings.However, it must be noted that not all carbs are created equal. Those that are refined can wreak havoc on your system, so use some caution when it comes to cakes, white bread, sweets, and processed foods. On the other hand, unrefined carbs, and especially whole grains, are essential. Each day, be sure to include 1-2 servings of whole grains like oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, or spelt, she said.Some great sources of unsaturated fats include avocados, olive oil, and nuts, (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Some great sources of unsaturated fats include avocados, olive oil, and nuts, (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)Make sure youre getting in your good fats especially Omega-3sLike carbs, fats havent always garnered the best reputation. Trans fats and saturated fats actually arent so great for you, but there are some fats that are extremely important.Unsaturated fats are incredibly beneficial to heart health, and Omega-3s, in particular, play an instrumental role in everything from anxiety management, to reducing inflammation, balancing hormones, and even improving skin. To make sure youre getting enough, add Omega-3 rich foods into your diet a couple of times each day. Some easy ones to add are chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts. Salmon and other fatty fish are also good sources, she shared.Some of the other unsaturated fats that are great to work into your diet are avocados, olive oil, and nuts, but you dont need a whole lot of these. A little, in moderation, on a regular basis will do the trick.Have at least three cups of greens and other non-starchy vegetables per dayMost of us have grown up being told to eat our vegetables and with good reason. Not only are vegetables rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, but the non-starchy ones are an excellent source of fibre as well.Fibre is critical to regulating blood sugar levels and is important to gut health as it aids with digestion and preserving the balance of your gut microbiome. One of the best things you can do for your gut (and overall health) is to consistently eat a wide array of greens and other fibre-rich vegetables. Aim to incorporate at least three cups of cooked non-starchy vegetables each day, she said.While there are certainly lots of other things that are beneficial to your health, the things that really make a difference are the ones that you do most consistently. Start by incorporating these three simple, yet highly effective strategies; if you can make them happen almost every day, then youll definitely see and feel the difference!For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle",rice,1,0.7047224669055487

Why not whip up a batch of Easter eggs with your loved ones? Experts share tips for first-timersFrom pretty pastel marzipan shades to velvety chocolate hues and everything in between, there is a childlike wonder to receiving Easter eggs. It really does not matter if they are elaborately designed or just wrapped in shiny tin foil, the anticipation of being gifted one is well worth the wait.The fact you get them just at this time of year, makes them all the more desirable. Every other delicacy and baked delight can be conjured up at birthdays or Christmas or any other special occasion  except Easter eggs.Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in Bengaluru | Photo Credit: Special arrangementAnd while egg-shaped chocolates with little toys inside can be bought off the shelf any day of the year now, there is still a lot of fun to be had in making your own Easter eggs. They may not look perfect the first time round, but the glorious mess and lingering aroma of hot chocolate or the sticky sweetness of marzipan that goes into fashioning one, will have you at it till you get it right.Though the process seems pretty straightforward, there are some directions you must keep in mind to achieve the desired ovoid result.First, the basicsYou will need: Cooking chocolate, food thermometer, candy treatsTo begin with, one needs to melt chocolate to the right temperature. Called tempering, this step is needed to keep the chocolate smooth and glossy and more importantly, to keep it from melting easily; a big plus when fashioning an Easter egg.So how do you temper chocolate? Firstly, never heat chocolate directly. Put two-thirds of your cooking chocolate in a bowl and hold it over a saucepan of boiling water. Keep stirring till it melts. Take it away from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate, all the while stirring so it melts too.Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in BengaluruMake sure you use a food thermometer while tempering chocolate. It will break easily if the consistency is not right, says Sunita Rebecca, a home baker from Hyderabad.Ideally, the temperature of the chocolate should not exceed 120F for dark chocolate or 105F for milk or white chocolate.Sounds tiresome? Rohit Thomas Kadicheeni of Silvis Creations, Kochi, recommends that first timers use compound chocolate instead of cooking chocolate, as it does not need tempering.It doesnt melt so fast either, making it easier to work with. Melt it, set it and your egg is done, he says.However, he does warn against trying to melt a bar of store-bought chocolate. It would need tempering too, he cautions.Next, smear the melted chocolate on the insides of a mould with a basting brush. If you do not have a brush, swirl the chocolate around the insides of the mould and remove the excess.If you dont have a mould, reuse a Kinder Joy casing or any other rounded object to make your eggs, says Meena Faszer, a home baker from Bengaluru. Online tutorials advocate the use of balloons for the same purpose.Next, refrigerate the mould for 10-15 minutes till the chocolate solidifies. Apply another layer of chocolate and refrigerate for another 10-15 minutes. Repeat the process for a third coat.Remember, the more layers you have, the stronger the egg shell.Once you are done with the layering process, ease the egg halves out of the moulds.Oiling the moulds before you begin makes this step easier and gives your egg shell a glossy finish. Fill one half of your egg with smaller sweet treats.Place the other half on a warm surface, just enough to melt the edges a bit and then glue both the halves together.Voila! And there you have it  your very first Easter egg!Easter eggs by Sris Cake Lab in BengaluruOnce you have a number of eggs ready, decorating them is a fun family pastime  whether you are icing shapes or names on them or just getting them basket ready, says Meena.You can decorate your eggs with melted chocolate or icing sugar. White chocolate or milk chocolate stands out if you are writing something on the egg, though you can use the same chocolate base for simple decorative designs. (It is also a great way to use up any extra melted chocolate).You can use icing sugar paste that can be coloured for brighter designs. Just fill up a piping bag and use different nozzles to make a variety of patterns.If you dont have a piping bag: Find a small plastic bag that is of a sturdy quality, roughly about the size of your palms. Fill it halfway with your icing of choice. Squeeze the filling to a corner of the plastic bag, giving it a conical shape and secure the opening with a rubber band or tape.Finally, cut the tip of the cone  you now have a home made piping bag. Keep in mind the surface area you will be working on. Snipping out a biggish piece of the corner will leave you with a lot of icing gushing out; which might be difficult to manage on a small egg.If you are fairly confident of your skills and/or have a steady hand, you can also roll up butter paper or parchment paper into a cone and use it instead of a piping bag.If not chocolate...Easter eggs can be made with marshmallows too, says Sunita Rebecca. Melt marshmallows and add crushed rice Krispies to the mix and you get a pliable, colourful medium you can use to shape eggs.Rice cereal is required to bring stiffness to the melted marshmallows, which would otherwise be too runny to use.Moisten your hands with water or dab butter on your palms to make the moulding easier, advises Sunita.According to Srivatsan S of Sris Cake Lab, Bengaluru, Marzipan is a great medium to make Easter eggs as you can use a lot of colours on them. Srivatsan, who has been creating themed Easter eggs this season, uses cashew paste instead of the traditional almond paste for his marzipan.You have to realise this is a very delicate material and an oily substance as well, so dont be discouraged if it doesnt turn out well the first few times. Youll eventually get the hang of it, he says.Once you do, it is almost as versatile as edible play dough, and can be moulded into any shape on its own without casings.Though marzipan eggs are not hollow, Srivatsan says people have been known to customise them by placing useful items like stationery instead of candy inside. Once you have your fillings decided, all that is left is icing. Pour some icing sugar into a piping bag and just have fun!",rice,1,0.6969251661754147

Just like last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spanner in the celebrations with number of positive cases rising every day. However, it has not dulled the spirit of worshippers who are happy to attend the virtual services from home and share a meal with their families.Talking about the services being held over the Holy Week, Father MM Kennedy from St Francis Xavier Church in Yapral, says: Our services are being held both physically and virtually. We are following government restrictions and allowing only a certain number of worshippers inside the church so as to follow physical distancing. We have open grounds outside the church and that makes the process easier. We had the morning service which reminds us of Jesus instituting the Eucharist and priesthood.Besides these, we carry out the ritual of washing feet which symbolises work of the Lord as service to the people. Today, on Good Friday, we remember the passion and death of our Lord, and we marked the Way of The Cross (14 stations) by taking all safety precautions. During the evening, we will follow Veneration of The Cross. On Saturday, at around 10 pm, we will hold the night Easter vigil which marks the Resurrection of Jesus.Roydin Roach, who is the Telangana president of the All India Catholic Union, says: In Hyderabad, we saw a large number of people offering prayers on Good Friday while taking Covid-19 precautions. Many parishes are broadcasting their services online through their own YouTube channels or Facebook Live feature. Liturgy TV, Catholic Hub and Divyavani TV are a few of the channels which telecast all services, in Hindi and English, live from city churches. We saw tableau and plays enacted across churches on Good Friday. At a few places, only the actors were allowed on the church grounds, while worshippers watched them from home. The night Easter Vigil, which can go on till 1:30 am, is the most important service of Easter. It involves rituals like lighting the candles and sprinkling of holy water.Easter is also the time of feasting for those who have been observing Lent fast for 40 days. Talking about the different dishes that are prepared during the fasting period and its culmination, Jacqueline Nicholas from Jackies Patisserie & Cafe says: My chicken roasts sell like hot cakes on Easter. Many followers do not eat meat during the 40-day period. The fasting ends after the Easter night service and people celebrate with chicken roasts along with grilled vegetables and Easter eggs. We have the tradition of eating hot cross buns and Kanji rice with various chutneys on Good Friday. The dish, to which no tadka is added, is prepared with rice, roasted moong dal and grated coconut. I made groundnut, onion and coconut chutneys to go with Kanji this year.Sujatha Stephen, who is a nutritionist with Yashodha Hospital, says that Easter is an auspicious festival for her family. Describing a typical Easter day at her home, she says: We start preparations for Easter after Good Friday. Due to the pandemic, we are not attending the early morning service at church and will be part of it virtually. In the pre-pandemic days, I used to go to St Georges Church. We would decorate the church with jasmine flowers. After the service, we would be offered Easter eggs which were boiled eggs with coloured shells. At home, we eat chocolate Easter eggs, cakes and a special meal. We marinate turkey in the morning and grill it to perfection. Later, at a lunch attended by friends and family, we serve it with either coconut rice or chicken biryani.

The company claims it is the worlds largest. The construction had begun in early 2019; the place was set for inauguration in August 2020. The pandemic, however, threw a spanner in the works. Then, on March 27, the microbrewery, measuring 1.3 lakh sq ft, was inaugurated with COVID protocols in place.Despite the delay, Teja is happy about setting up the microbrewery in Bengaluru. If you are a brewery, you have to be in Bengaluru. It is the beer capital of India, he says. Bengaluru, however, is not new territory for Teja. He started the Prost Brew Pub in Koramangala. Ironhill then started outlets in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Hyderabad.The 2.9-acre microbrewery will serve eight varieties of beer and can accommodate over 1500 people at a time. The place is designed to resemble a resort with a bridge spanning an artificial pond, Art Deco pieces, art installations, water fountains among other things.Despite the luxurious ambience, Teja believes the microbrewery will appeal to a wide range of people. We have a wide variety of seating arrangements, he says, People can sit near the sunken pool immersing their legs in the water. There are also cabanas and other indoor seating, for those who prefer a different ambience. We have also fixed the prices to draw a wide section of people.The food and beverages menu for such a huge place is expectedly exhaustive. There are wines, champagnes, whiskeys, cocktails, shots, mocktails and more. On the food menu, you find the usual platters, international dishes and also local flavours like ghee sambar rice with an omelette.Teja, due to another wave of COVID cases in Bengaluru, expects the footfall to be less in the first few weeks. We didnt foresee this second wave. With the vaccines out, we thought things would drastically improve, he says. We will be operating with less than 50% occupancy, as per the protocols.

The sun sets and a refreshing breeze blows through Thekkinkadu Maidan, the heart of Thrissur city. High-mast lamps illuminate the park. The hundreds of elders and youngsters, who gather there after a hectic day, discuss current affairs like rising fuel prices, the impact of Covid on trade and, of course, politics. Thrissur, the constituency, is witnessing a high-profile, three-cornered fight among UDFs Padmaja Venugopal, NDAs Suresh Gopi and LDFs P Balachandran.As poll campaigning reached a crescendo on Tuesday, the discussions revolved around election trends. BJPs slogan: We are giving Thrissur to you, was also a topic.Will it happen? The opinions are divided. One thing is sure, that Suresh Gopi is making waves in the constituency and even if he doesnt win, he can make or mar the chances of his rivals.ITI instructor Rajan said, It is a three-cornered fight and LDFs vote share will come down to 45,000 from 53,000 polled by V S Sunil Kumar in 2016. Forward caste votes will get divided between Padmaja and Suresh Gopi. NDA will poll 35,000 riding on the Suresh Gopi factor and UDF vote share will come down. LDF candidate P Balachandran can win with traditional Left votes.Though P Balachandran may not get personal votes, the goodwill created by the government through welfare schemes may aid him. People from marginalised sections survived the lockdown with the food kits distributed by the government, said Jose Kuriachira, who had to discontinue his gold wholesale business due to the loss incurred during the lockdown.Prabhakaran, a trader at Kuttimukku, differs. There is no Pinarayi wave. Whatever PR exercise you conduct, people can judge for themselves. UDF will come to power in state. Padmaja will win, he said.In another corner, Sreejith and Sivadas, both computer service personnel, are discussing Suresh Gopis prospects. There is a chance for him as he is known to have supported the poor using his MP fund, said Sreejith.They talk about food kits and rice only. Is it the right development model? We need more industries. Suresh Gopi helped many people through charity and by facilitating their return from West Asian countries in Vande Bharat flights. It will not be a surprise if he wins, said Sivadas.Autorickshaw driver Johnson said odds are in Padmajas favour. She is familiar here and voters sentiments towards her father K Karunakaran is a factor. However, there is a change in BJPs favour among upper class Christians, Though known as a UDF bastion, the family of Karunakaran has unpleasant memories in Thrissur.Karunakaran was defeated by V V Raghavan in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections while his son K Muraleedharan lost in 1998. Padmaja was defeated by V S Sunil Kumar in 2016 from Thrissur.Therambil Ramakrishnan represented Thrissur for five terms and Thrissur stood with my father even when he lost in 1996. People here know me and cannot be fooled through food kits. Suresh Gopi will get only BJP votes, said Padmaja.Projects implemented by Sunil Kumar as MLA to address issues like drinking water and infrastructure will work in LDFs favour. The poor who are struggling to tide over lockdown blues cannot be fooled by raising the Sabarimala issue, said Balachandran. Suresh Gopi urged voters to choose NDA to ensure happiness, peace and protection of rights. If you think NDA will need time to take the reins of power, cast your votes to transform BJP into a corrective force in the state, he told voters at Thiruvambady.Activist K Venu, a former Naxalite, feels Padmaja has an edge in the battle. Though Balachandran is known among party workers, he is not as popular as Sunil Kumar. The governments welfare measures have influenced marginalised sections. However, it would be the 10% neutral votes that prove crucial in Thrissur, he said.With campaigning set to end soon, the three fronts are leaving no stone unturned to attract voters. It is a neck-and-neck battle in Thrissur and voters are holding the cards close to their chest.",rice,1,0.6541732982947136

Easily, it is through songs and punch dialogues. None other than the Dravidian majors, who used films to reach the masses, could have understood it better.Adhimoolam, a functionary of DMKs literary wing, told The New Indian Express, Despite many of our poll promises and policies being good, there is a difficulty in taking them to the people as many do not understand them. At the same time, catchy songs like Stalin than vararu, vidiyal thara poraru (Stalin is coming and he will bring us dawn) bring cheer and enthusiasm among the party cadre.Viralimalai Manickam, who has been involved in poll-related works since 1967, told The New Indian Express, During the 1967 general elections, there was no practice of using many songs. At the time, DMK cadres aired the songs Oodivarugiran Udhaya Sooriyan (The rising sun is running to us), Azhaikinrar Anna (Anna invites) and some songs from MGR films, which highlighted the DMKs ideology and CN Annadurais capability. He also recalled a punch dialogue based on the DMKs election promise  Moondru padi latchiyam, oru padi nichayam (Three padi is our goal, one padi is surety). Padi is a local measure approximately equivalent to 1.5 kg of rice. The punch dialogue worked as a game changer and brought the DMK to power in the State.Veteran journalist T Koodalarasan said, But, the situation has widely changed after the death of former Chief Minister CN Annadurai. The 1971 general election witnessed several personality-centric songs such as Naangu kodi Makkalukku Thalaivan (Leader of four crore people) to glorify the then Chief Minister Karunanidhi. Later, the airing of tracks singing glories of personalities became normal after MGR floated AIADMK and contested elections. Now, all leaders want the tracks to sing only their glories instead of highlighting the ideologies of the party, he underlined.Some of the famous songs and punch dialogues of DMK & AIADMK1967DMK: Oodivarugiran Udhayasooriyan (Rising sun is running to us), Azhaikkindrar Anna(Anna invites)1977DMK : Kallakudikonda Karunanidhi Vazhgave (Long live Karunanidhi, who won through protests in Kallakudi)1980AIADMK: What sin did I commit?

If one party promises monthly assistance of Rs 1,000 to women household heads, there is a counter offer of Rs 1,500. It goes on. The result is people started having a mindset that they could make a living out of freebies,"" a Division Bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi said.A trend has been created that whoever avails loan from banks does not repay them, expecting waiver of loans during election.In this way, people themselves get corrupted by the political parties.The way in which the parties throw their promises, which are unreasonable and unworkable, are really unwanted.""Unfortunately, freebies are not connected with job creation, development, or agriculture. Voters are lured to cast votes in their favour by these magical promises. Once in 5 years, this tamasha is being continued for decades together. Promises have always remained as promises. Most of them except freebies are not implemented,"" it said.The Bench noted that every candidate has to shell out about Rs 20 crore in the election, as many of the people have become corrupt by selling their votes for one or a few thousands, biriyani and liquor.""It is a stark reality. If that is so, how could the people expect good leaders. Do people, who sell their votes, have any moral right to question their leaders,"" the Bench wondered.The judges opined that if money spent for freebies is utilised constructively by creating job opportunities, building infrastructure like dams and lakes and better facilities and incentives to the agriculture, which has become an 'orphan' in the country as most of the people have quit it as it does not provide a secure income, definitely, there will be social uplift and progress of the State.The political parties should be prohibited or prevented from giving election promises, which are capable of adding burden on the public exchequer, especially, the State facing a financial crunch, it said.Otherwise, for the sake of finance, the State has to increase the number of liquor shops.Every political party is bound to make promises to voters giving their social policies and plans for improving the standard of living of the people by providing clean governance, infrastructure, especially, providing basic amenities like water, transportation and health.But, the promises made by the political parties are aimed at clinching power, it said.In addition to colour televisions, laptops, mixers, fans and grinders among others, every family cardholder in the State is given 20 kgs of rice free every month.That apart, during festival seasons like Pongal and Diwali, public money is drained.In fact, the celebrations are being taken care of by the government by providing free dhoties, sarees and items necessary for cooking and making pongal and expenses for celebrations.""These kinds of freebies and money given during festivals, though it would be justified that the government is taking care of the people's needs, in fact are making the people lazy and dampening their working culture,"" it said ""In the process, the honest tax-payer is made a mute spectator of these expenditures by the government,"" it said.Consequently, even for any normal work, no force is available in Tamil Nadu and it has to depend on the migrant workers from northeast and northern states like Manipur, Meghalaya, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha, the Bench said.Most of the North Indian workers are employed in agriculture work, hotels, industries, shops and saloons in Tamil Nadu.""It is not as if everyone in Tamil Nadu have become an entrepreneur or persons with resources and if we go into details, most of the persons including the wealthy are expecting freebies,"" the court said.The way in which things are happening today, one would not be surprised to see that migrant workers would be owners of the properties in due course and the sons of the soil will become workers working under them.It may be the only achievement, probably, the political parties have attained through election promises by providing freebies for the past 20 years, the judges said.",rice,1,0.6205122400972739

With this order, the state government can continue the distribution of rice as fixed earlier.Justice PV Asha issued the order on the petition filed by the state of Kerala represented by the Additional Secretary to Government of Kerala, Food and Civil Supplies Department seeking to quash the order of the Commission.The Election Commission requested the court to ensure that the stay order shall not be used as a weapon in the election by the ruling party to influence the voters. The court made it clear that the distribution should be strictly in accordance with the manual of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).All ostentatious functions should be strictly avoided with regard to the rice distribution and no impression should be given or allowed to be created that such welfare measures or relief and rehabilitation works are being undertaken by the government in office so as to influence the electors in favour of the party in power.ALSO READ: Kerala elections: Congress alleges widespread irregularities in postal votingThe state government argued that the Model Code of Conduct does not apply to the implementation of ongoing programmes. The decision regarding the special distribution was taken on February 4, much before the election notification. The decision was taken on based on the budget speech of the Finance Minister.In the Kerala Budget, 2021, the government announced additional rice of 10 kg at the rate of Rs 15 would be provided to 50 lakh families having blue and white ration cards, which means non prioritised categories. Hence it will not fall under the prohibition under the Model Code of Conduct, said the government.The government had ordered that the additional rice required for the distribution must be procured from the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The state, thereafter, successfully got an auction acceptance offer for rice worth Rs 84 crore from the OMSS of the FCI. If the scheme does not materialise by March 30, the state will have to take steps for a fresh auction, which may entail an additional burden on it.The concept of a welfare state implies governmental interference for the welfare of its citizens. Such a social welfare measure is the need of the hour in this pandemic situation coupled with the fast-approaching Vishu-Easter festive season and subsequent Ramzan. It was settled law that the object of the MCC is not to stop all governmental activities in the state. If at all the Election Commission were worried of opposition from some political party, that alone is not a material factor. Hence, the act of the commission is not legally sustainable.The Election Commission submitted that a screening committee consisting of the Chief Secretary has been constituted to streamline the grant of permissions regarding the issues arising out of the model code of conduct. The purpose is to expedite the grant of permission wherever an issue arises. The proposal which was forwarded by the screening committee doesn't disclose any of the aspects mentioned in the writ petition.Clause 5.4.1 of the manual of MCC with regard to the announcement of financial grants, concessions, relief and subsidy clearly stated that the Election Commission invariably takes a humanitarian view on the works that are necessitated due to man-made and natural calamities. It does not refuse approval for schemes undertaken for tackling emergencies or for providing relief to people suffering from drought, floods, pestilences, other natural calamities or welfare measures for the aged and infirm. In these matters, however, prior approval of the Election Commission should be taken.In this case, the proposal was insufficient and it was not the opposition or any other political party has raised objection regarding the distribution. The aspect that the last date for the tender is on March 30 is not before the Commission. Let the government file a fresh proposal, argued the Commission.",rice,1,0.6165247914292019

Even as the pandemic required us to enjoy with only a handful of known people, Bura na mano Holi hai reverberated through the day on Monday as people splashed each other with gulal and drenched one another with pichkaris of coloured water in shades of blues, yellows, greens and reds.Along with the elaborate colourful gaiety, like all Indian festivals, the focus was on lip-smacking food. Dahi bhalla, bhaang vade, pakoda, flavoured bhang drinks and thandai... from gujiyas to malpuas, the scrumptious variety of delicacies is difficult to say no to. However, just as the after-effects of artificial colours on the skin can be harmful to the body, over-indulgence in sweets and other delicacies can also cause an upset tummy.This means it is a perfect time to detox. Detoxification helps to reduce the toxin base in the body, give the organs rest and help the body rejuvenate, says city-based clinical nutritionist, Deepika Chalasani.Detox the bodyDr Srikanth HS, senior naturopath, Jindal Naturecure Institute shares simple hacks that will go a long way towards boosting the bodys natural detoxification process.Avoid alcoholGet eight hours of sleepKeep yourself hydrated with at least three liters of waterSulphur rich foods such as onions, garlic, and broccoli help counteract the adverse effects of harmful heavy metalsReplace sugary drinks and junk food with healthier alternativesDetox drinksIndulged a little bit more than you should have? Detox drinks are fun, tasty and convenient way to reduce the bodys inflammation and toxin base, says Deepika. She recommends quick drinks that will help.Green juices: Made of moringa leaves/as gourd/cucumber, ginger and lemon/spinach, celery and coconut water with mint/bottle gourd.Anti-inflammatory drinks: Turmeric, ginger, pepper and cinnamon juice with lemon.Smoothies: Mixed greens with parsley and half banana and strawberries; cucumber with carrots, beetroot, ginger and mint with a bunch of grapes.Rejuvenate your hair and skinAll those colours can wreak havoc on your skin making it feel clogged. Hyderabad-based Dr Shuba Dharmana, CEO/Founder, Lejeune Group of Medspas tells us how to detox skin post Holi.Use an oil-based cleanser to cleanse skin using circular upward massaging strokes. Double cleanse with oil and facewash. Avoid oil-based if you have oily skin.Moisturise skin and use sunscreen to protect from further damage.Wash colour off hair with shampoo. Make a deep conditioning hair mask by mixing ripe avocado, 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp honey.For the body, use a moisturising body wash.Use a pumice stone, sponge or loofah to exfoliate.Use moisturising cream or lotion on the body after shower.Hydrate cuticles and lips with a balm.Apply Calamine lotion over irritated areas if rashes, itching or red patches develop.Soothe the eyesGulal contains chemicals such lead oxide, copper sulfate, asbestos, or silica. Liquid colours may also contain an alkali base. If these enter the eye, they can cause allergic reactions, irritation, or rarely chemical injury that may affect vision, says Dr Milind Naik, consultant ophthalmologist and eye plastic surgeon, LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. Milind recommends:Cup your palms gently and fill them up with clean water. Lower your face, and immerse the eyes into the water. Try and open your eyes, blink frequently and move your eyes around to help rinse off the colour. Another method would be for someone to hold the affected persons eyes open, and allow a gentle stream of clean water trickle over the surface of the eye from its outer corner flowing towards inner corner.Do not use contact lenses as the chemicals can retain as a depot, and leak out of the lenses causing prolonged damage to the surface of the eye. It would be a good idea to avoid contact lenses for one to three weeks until the eye is completely healed. Tamanna S Mehditamanna@newindianexpress.com@tamannamehdi",onion,0,0.6857716683166397
2021-03-29,https://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/other/2021/mar/29/ghost-of-sparta-vintage-replay-2282855.html,Ghost of Sparta: Vintage replay,"Anusha Ganapathi ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: In keeping with my replay theme for 2021, I replayed God of War: Ghost of Sparta. The game released as a PSP exclusive, so I managed to borrow one from a kind friend. In these difficult days where the prospect of receiving a tangible Ragnarok update seems bleaker than getting one for Valimai, reliving classics in the franchise will make us feel good, if only temporarily.Ghost of Sparta is a game that is very sure of itself. It is almost as confident as its protagonist, the angry and unconscientious Kratos. However, its confidence might fool us into thinking it is also steadfast. Oh no. Let me explain. The PSP has a tiny screen, smaller than the average phone screen of 2021. The PSP also does not have a right joystick, forcing a stable camera angle. One would assume that these constraints would make the game linear, and therefore easy. GoW however, is sure of itself, sure to fool us into a sense of comfort in knowing what lies ahead.The story in this game involves the Ghost of Sparta seeking out his long-lost brother, Deimos. The storyline is punctuated by flashbacks of Kratos youth. The pathway to fixing his past is simple. Kratos must visit the Temple of Poseidon, defeat Scylla, slash Callisto to learn no new information, defeat Thanatos daughter, use the key of Crete, cross the Gates of Herakleon, travel to the Temple of Ares, then to the Jails of Sparta . *inhales deeply*. receive the Arms of Sparta, stumble into Midas, find the statue of Poseidon in the city of Atlantis, and then enter the Domain of Death to search his brother. See? Simple. Ghost of Sparta would really be a joyful story about a man going on a pilgrimage; that is, if we didnt see him ripping peoples heads off so often.The path that Kratos takes is filled with a lot of traffic. There are huge spiders spitting poison, cyclops, minotaurs, automatons that can only be destroyed by a special fire, hounds, and more! However, Kratos is armed with the powers to destroy them. But as they get stronger, we must ensure that he has enough orbs, horns, feathers, and eyes (so weird) to max out the upgrades.You might just overuse one power-up the spinning chains one, but you still need upgrades! Here, the illusion of the stable camera angles forces us to explore. An old-school puzzle. The game shows us a main path. But there may be a chest hidden, just out of sight. Except for the story, Ghost of Sparta feels like concept art for the recent God of War games. While some bits may not have aged well, the game is right in being confident, as it provides a healthy challenge for one that is 11 years old. 299/300 for the Spartan.Anusha Ganapathi(This economics graduate spends her leisure time preparing for the zombie apocalypse)",tomato,0,0.6597833807044452
2021-04-03,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pinarayi-vijayan-kerala-cm-assembly-elections-7257638/,Pinarayi Vijayan: Captain comrade who led Kerala in crisis,"On a sweltering afternoon on March 30, at a public ground in Kanhangad in Keralas Kasaragod district, a car halts near a waiting crowd. As Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alights from the vehicle, the crowd surges ahead, mobile phones go up as if in salute, slogans pierce the air and CPI(M) central committee member P Karunakaran announces: Keralas captain is here  the captain who led Kerala in crisis.Unlike neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which has monikers for its leaders (Kaliagnar, Thalaivar and Captain)  Kerala hasnt had that tradition, with a rare exception probably being the late Congress leader K Karunakaran, who was called Leader in party circles. But as Kerala votes on April 6, the ruling Left Democratic Fronts (LDF) entire campaign has revolved around this branding of Vijayan as captain, as the man in charge.As the LDF hopes to buck the trend of voters alternating between the CPM-led front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), Vijayan is its only headliner and, amazingly for someone known to deliver the most tepid of speeches, its principal crowd puller.Pinarayi Vijayan interview: | Pinarayi Vijayan interview: The anti-Kerala stand of Congress, BJP, their communal overtures are our main challengeThe crisis managerVijayan as the man-in-charge is an image that has been steadily building over the last few years with his governments handling of successive challenges  cyclone Okhi of 2017, Nipah outbreak of 2018, the devastating floods of 2018 and 2019, and last years pandemic.During the floods, Vijayan operated as a commander of a rescue mission would. The temporary war room he set up coordinated with uniformed forces, state machinery and volunteer groups. Every evening, he would address the media and update the public about the magnitude of the calamity and the governments efforts towards restoring normalcy.Read | In Kerala, Modi raises Sabarimala chant, says LDF destabilising sacred placesVijayan also activated the three-tier local bodies, mostly party-ruled, to respond swiftly to the post-flood rehabilitation challenges. He took the Opposition into confidence and converted the rescue and rehabilitation efforts into a peoples movement.Vijayans acumen as crisis manager was in display again during last years Covid lockdown.While images of migrant workers left high and dry came from across the country, in Kerala, around 4 lakh migrant workers were under the care of the government or entrusted in the care of their employers.Explained A five-decade-old tradition Not after C Achutha Menon, the CPI leader who took over as CM in 1969, has Kerala had a chief minister with two consecutive terms in the state. Which is why, Pinarayi Vijayan, the LDF's CM candidate, is being watched for whether he will end up breaking the state's tradition of alternating between LDF and UDF governments.The humanitarian crisis triggered by the lockdown saw the government stepping in with two welfare measures  free food kits and advance payment of welfare pensions. An estimated 87 lakh PDS card-holders in Kerala were given free kits with rice, wheat, pulses, tea, sugar, cooking oil, spices, suji and soaps. The monthly pension scheme to six categories, including elderly farm workers, single women and the elderly, covers an estimated 61 lakh people, with the government spending Rs 32,034 crore over the last five years.Mullappally Ramachandran interview:  | BJP can grow in Kerala only by splitting the secular vote It is a dangerous schemeIn December, the government announced that the food kits would continue to be distributed for another four months. Besides, in the budget for 2021, the government increased the monthly welfare pensions from Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600  a move seen as taken with elections in mind.From northern Malabar region to Thiruvananthapuram in the south, these welfare measures have been a talking point among voters.Pinarayi should come back to power. He ensured we didnt starve. He ensured food reached families in their most difficult times  the floods and now, during the pandemic. We cannot be ungrateful to him, says Basheer, a daily wage worker in Kozhikode town.P Kumar, who runs a small textile shop in Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram, enthusiastically shows text messages from the bank of the Rs 1,600 credited into his account as old age pension.During the pandemic, Vijayan emerged again on television with his 6 pm Covid bulletin, his measured updates on the pandemic and its spread reassuring people and sending TRPs soaring. Besides sharing data on testing and positivity rates, Vijayan would speak about the governments relief measures, the need to care for each other and the destitute.As this bulletin became a staple in almost every home, Vijayans image as a cold, impassive comrade underwent a makeover, especially among women.Also Read | The World Citizen as boy next door: In Palakkad, Tharoor and TharoorismsDuring those days, his was the only voice that emerged from the governments side. Though two ministers and the chief secretary shared the dais with the chief minister for the daily press briefings, it was only Vijayan who fielded questions and offered clarifications, never once turning to his colleagues or the top bureaucrat.But while these moves and public appearances helped build Vijayans image, they also invited criticism around the personality cult building around him. He has also been called mundu udutha Modi (Modi in dhoti) with reference to his autocratic style of functioning and alleged lack of consultation with allies.C P John, chief of the Communist Marxist Party (CMP), a faction that broke off from the CPM and is now part of the UDF, said Vijayan is not guided by the politburo but PR agencies.Instead of addressing issues such as landlessness of weaker sections and tribals, the government speaks about the food kit. Ration is a basic right. Vijayan talks as if it is charity from a feudal king to his subjects. His emergence as captain shows the crisis in the party, said John.CPI(M) politburo member M A Baby, however, dismisses the idea of the personality cult. Vijayan has not taken any credit for the achievements. The idea of captain emerged from the public in Kerala. People of the state have seen how Vijayan led them through crises, be it floods or pandemic. The party didnt bestow that title on him, he said.Also Read | Congress banks on a 26-year-old dairy farmer to break into a Kerala Left bastion of 15 yearsThe administratorUnder Vijayan, the LDF government has been unabashed about its shift to a capital  and market-intensive development strategy.The LDF is showcasing work done on the GAIL project  its Kerala leg is a 503-km pipeline from Kochi to Bengaluru and Mangaluru  as among its key achievements, though it had opposed the project while in Opposition.With protests against land acquisition, which the CPI(M) had spearheaded while in Opposition, now subdued, several delayed road projects are now being executed, including the Thalassery-Mahe bypass which was conceived 50 years ago.If in 2012 Achuthanandan had rushed to Kudankulam to join the anti-nuclear protesters, Vijayan cleared land acquisition for the 400 kV power highway from Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu to Madakkathara in Kerala.Former chief minister Oommen Chandy says, The CPI(M) should apologise to the people of Kerala for delaying infrastructure projects. They protested against the GAIL pipeline calling it a bomb ticking underground. They led protests against land acquisitions, delaying highway-widening work. But now they have no problem taking credit.People wearing mask while attending a rally. (Photo: AP) People wearing mask while attending a rally. (Photo: AP)In 2019, Kerala became the first Indian state to tap into the market for masala bonds, with the state-owned Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) debuting on the London Stock Exchange to raise development funds. A decade ago, the CPI(M)-led government was divided over taking loans even from the Asian Development Bank.While the KIIFB has come under the scanner of the Comptroller and Auditor General, with the auditor saying its borrowings have no legislative nod, the government has raised money from the domestic and international market to finance 900-odd projects worth Rs 7,000 crore.So while the relief and welfare measures were mainly targeted at the lower rungs of society, for the middle- and upper-middle classes, Vijayan had his development agenda to showcase in the form of a massive infrastructure push with funds routed through KIIFB  primary health centres to rival private hospitals and high-tech classrooms in government/aided schools.Last month, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had accused the KIIFB of corruption, saying, What is this organisation? We also make a Budget in the Union government. We dont give all money to one particular agency total questionable operation. If this is budget-making, no wonder Kerala is going into a debt trap.Baby dismisses these criticisms: There are detractors who say the states debt liability is going up. There is nothing wrong in availing loans for development. Even the US has huge debt liability.Even as Vijayan earned the image of a doer, his office and the departments he handled faced several scandals and controversies, with the gold smuggling case landing right at the CMOs door  Vijayans principal secretary M Sivasankar was arrested in the gold smuggling case.But while critics point to this case and a string of other allegedly high-handed decisions under Vijayan  the MoU for deep-sea trawlers signed despite opposition from fishermen, slapping of UAPA charges against two CPM cadres in Kozhikode for alleged Maoist links, encounter killings of eight alleged Maoists, besides others  his supporters point to the governments decision to put on hold the amended Kerala Police Act as sign of its responsiveness.Days after the government brought in a controversial amendment to the Act that mandated a jail term for any offensive social media post, it withdrew the law following a hailstorm of criticism from across the political spectrum.According to N P Chekkutty, a leading political analyst, Vijayan is the only leader after Karunakaran to find acceptability across all regions of the state  Malabar, Central Kerala and Travancore. Pinarayi knows Keralas politics. He is undoubtedly the tallest politician in the states recent history. In fact, his image has a Teflon coating now, said Chekkutty, explaining why the string of recent controversies and scandals havent dented his image.The politicianSceptics say that if Vijayan looks good, its in no small part due to the incoherence and confusion in the Opposition UDF camp.Especially for the youth, Vijayans image of a bold, decisive leader is a definite plus over the UDFs seemingly messy, out-in-the-open contradictions.Ashley Joy, a 23-year-old marketing professional from Chalakudy in Thrissur, says about the UDF, Who is their leader? Will they find time to govern the state after sorting out all differences? They are always busy pulling each other down.With every passing moment in the CPI(M), Vijayans hold on the party and his Cabinet has got stronger. Never before has the party or the LDF been controlled by an individual as in the last five years.Vijayans tenure has also been marked by a tense relationship between allies CPM and CPI, with the latter accusing the bigger party of sidestepping it.While taking the Kerala Congress (M) on board the LDF, Vijayan brushed aside the reluctance of the CPI, eventually setting aside 12 seats for regional Christian party and making it the third largest constituent of the LDF behind CPI.A CPI leader says, The party had to sacrifice to make space for the KC(M). We were opposed to the decision, but remained silent only because our aim is to come back for another term.Ahead of the elections, Vijayan made it mandatory for legislators who have had two consecutive wins to stay away from the electoral battle.Besides being aimed at blunting the anti-incumbency factor, the move helped keep out candidates who were proving to be a liability. For instance, by using the rule to keep out Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan, Vijayan reduced the dollar smuggling case, allegedly involving the Speaker, into a non-issue.Similarly, by denying tickets to P Jayarajan, E P Jayarajan and M V Jayarajan, the party heavyweights of his home district Kannur, Vijayan has once again underlined his supremacy.Yet, this chop-and-change style also saw unprecedented protests by CPI(M) workers and sympathisers against the official candidates, forcing the party to change candidates at least on two seats.But one issue that could prove to be a factor this election is the intensifying conflict between the Christians and Muslims over sharing minority rights.The Church leadership, which has expressed its displeasure over the increasing influence of the IUML in the UDF, has shown signs of getting close to the LDF. On his part, Vijayan has been keeping the Church leadership in good humour with measures such as providing 10 per cent reservation for economically backward classes and hiking MSP for rubber from Rs 150 to Rs 170 per kg, a major source of income in the Christian-dominated belts.He gives Muslims a sense of security. He has proved that he would stand by our rights, said C P Sirajudhin, manager of the Markaz orphanage in Kundamangalam near Kozhikode.While Vijayan and the LDF are positioning themselves as the only effective bulwark against the communal politics of the BJP, the governments position on Sabarimala, and its series of flip-flops, have only served to underline a lack of clarity. From what was seen as an all-too-eager rush to implement the Supreme Courts decision on temple entry for all to expressing regret over the 2018 police action against devotees, the party has travelled a long way. The issue has returned to haunt the government with the upper-caste Hindu outfit, Nair Service Society, lashing out at Vijayan and accusing him of taking believers for a ride.His supporters, however, see this too as a sign of flexibility, an essential tool for political survival. They point to the results of successive elections to make their point. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections held in the aftermath of the anti-temple entry protests, the LDF lost 19 of 20 seats to the UDF. Since then, the LDF has gone out of its way to woo devotees. In the local body polls held last year, the LDF came back with a big win. While the BJP hopes to pin down the government on Sabarimala, the game is up in the air.Amidst this and all the other uncertainties that make up an election, what is certain is Vijayans near complete hold on the party and its apparatus. Will a win or a loss change that? Over to April 6.",rice,0,0.6386791989327607

But races are so close, with timings measured in thousandth of a second.And it is a young flyer's game.Lightning-fast reflexes, visual sharpness and hours of training are the key to success, according to Kang.He says he is already facing physical decline as a new generation of younger rivals arrives, some of them still in primary school.""Those qualities are the best in your early- to mid-teenage years,"" said the still pimply-faced pilot.Kang said his reflexes were ""inevitably"" slowing with each passing year, and he was not ruling out retirement before turning 20.It will be ""pretty tough to compete against them in my adult years,"" he said.""I think I may not make it past this year.""One 12-year-old girl already has him in her sights.""When I first met Kang Chang-hyeon, I was in awe of him and it felt like a dream,"" said Jeong Ryeo-won, after taking part in a league round in the southern county of Hadong.But now she ""really wants"" to beat him: ""He is my role model, so I hope to compete against him at the world championships , but win.""Only three years after first flying a toy drone, Kang, at age 16, took the world title at a 2019 championship in China, where South Korean pilots dominated.""Maintaining composure is key to winning because a split-second decision can determine the outcome of a race,"" he said.""Minimising your mistakes while staying calm regardless of who's ahead of you is critical.""Kang's high school in rural Hongseong county has sought to capitalise on his success by promoting itself as a specialist drone school -- with Kang as its ambassador -- offering lessons in piloting to attract more pupils.But the coronavirus pandemic deprived him of the chance to defend his crown at the peak of his abilities, when the Swiss-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, was forced to cancel the 2020 world championships.""I could have competed really well last year,"" he said.Like other young South Korean men achieving global success, from pop stars BTS to Spurs striker Son Heung-min , compulsory military service weighs on his path.South Korea remains technically at war with nuclear-armed North Korea , and all able-bodied South Korean males must spend around 18 months in the forces before they turn 30.The only exceptions are for Olympic medallists and Asian Games champions, along with the winners of some international classical music competitions.But Kang's skills could be of ""great value"" for the armed forces, said his coach Kim Jae-hong, who led the national team at the 2019 world championships.South Korea's 555,000-strong military is heavily outnumbered by North Korea's 1.28 million troops.But the South enjoys technological superiority including, according to the defence ministry , a fleet of around 800 drones for training and experimental combat purposes.""The drone units' monitoring mission is basically based on controlling a drone with a camera live feed, which is the same for drone racing,"" the coach said.""Kang and other racers can contribute greatly to its mission while maintaining their drone-control skills.""",rice,0,0.6333956130659915
