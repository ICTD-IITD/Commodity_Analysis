The notification issued by the DGFT on March 2 comes following representations from various marketing yards and farmer bodies including Mahuva marketing yard to the union minister of agriculture last month.Traders believe that the onion prices in local markets are likely to increase as a result of export and the crop arrival this year has already been delayed by two months due to prolonged inclement weather last year.In Bhavnagar and Mahuva yard, onion selling at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per 20 kg shot up Rs 470 two days before the news came in that government was likely to allow the export.Narendra Gohil, an onion trader in Bhavnagar yard said, When exports start, we are expect rise in price. At present, onions from Nashik market are pouring in domestic market. One exports begin, the demand for the Mahuva quality onion will increase in domestic market.The government of India had banned onion export on September 29 last year after the prices crossed Rs 150 per kg in retail market. Amreli and Bhavnagar are the two biggest onion producing districts in Gujarat.The normal season for the onion production is January and February, but this year the harvest has been delayed due to prolonged monsoon.According to agriculture department data, the onion sowing area increased to 39,000 hecatre in Gujarat in current financial year from 25,000 ha last year. However the yield is likely to decrease by 30% this year. The onion flood yards during the peak season, but this year we dont expect much yield because of some disease also, Gohil added.Currently, 15,000 bags (each containing 50kg) are coming for auction in Bhavnagar and Mahuva yards. Every year during peak season, 1.50 lakh bags are brought for auction. This year, traders expect around 60,000 to 75,000 bags daily.Vitthal Koradia, an onion exporter said, Generally, the onion crop comes in winter, but this year when the peak season arrives in April, the temperature will be high, which will damage the crop.Ghanshyam Patel, secretary, Mahuva marketing yard said, On February 5, we had represented to the union agriculture minister to allow export."

Order NowPUNE: Onion was auctioned in the range of Rs8-17 per kg at Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday  the first instance of its wholesale price dipping below the double-figure since the beginning of the ongoing season in January.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials attributed the slump in the onions wholesale price to dip in demand for the produce. Also, they pointed out that the commission agents, who facilitate auction of the farm produce, opened their shops after a break of two weeks. As such, the intake of fresh onion was high in the market.A total of 11,534 quintals of onion arrived in Gultekdi yard on Wednesday. This was more than expected and hence, the prices fell sharply in the open auction, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of vegetables, fruits, onion and potato division of the market yard.He said, Usually, hoteliers and other eateries in the city buy a bulk of onions, but these establishments are closed because of the lockdown. So, there wasnt much demand for onion in the open auction, which drove the price down to the seasons lowest so far. The onions sold at Rs8 per kg was of low standard. But till date, even this type of onion was being sold above Rs12 per kg.The APMC officials claimed that there was adequate supply of kitchen staple, but retail vendors were selling the produce at high price. Outside market yard, vendors are selling onion for anything between Rs35 and Rs40 per kg. People need not worry about the intake or supply at least for next four weeks, Kalamkar said.The wholesale price of potato also took a dip from Rs22-25 per kg two days back to Rs20-22 per kg on Wednesday with 15,281 quintals of potato arriving in the market. The arrival was a surplus, the APMC officials stated.Maximum potato is purchased by vada pav or pav bhaji vendors, which are closed these days. We expect further fall in prices in the coming days, Kalamkar added.The five sub-markets across the city, too, received surplus onion and potato supplies.Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of AFMC, appealed to farmers and commission agents not to bring produce in a large number as only 400 vehicles of vegetables are permitted nowadays every day.Maintaining social distance and avoiding mass gathering is necessary in the current situation. If we get more than 400 vehicles, the market would be crowded and following or implementing the government guidelines would be impossible, Deshmukh said."
4,4,2020-04-02,Tips on storing food during coronavirus pandemic,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2020/apr/02/tips-on-storing-food-during-coronavirus-pandemic-2124503.html,"Kakoli Mukherjee ByExpress News ServiceThese uncertain times following COVID-19 outbreak have laid bare things which were being taken for granted for long.For example, our Rythu bazaars and our grocery home delivery services. Though the government has categorised them under essential supplies, the ground reality is different with leading delivery services suspending their operations.While hoarding is not advised, we can choose to stock up a pantry with food grains and items that have long shelf lives. Here, chef Shri Bala, heritage cusine expert gives some tips on how to store herbs and grains in a way so that they last a long time.Grains and lentils:Dry them for four hours in the sun. Put 2-3 sun-dried neem leaves at the bottom of an airtight container. Then put in the grains and again put 2-3 sun-dried neem leaves on top. This ensures that the grains stay free from insects for a long time.CorianderWash them thoroughly and cut the roots. Put them on a kitchen towel so that all moisture is absorbed. Then wrap them in paper napkins and store in a plastic container. Please do not separate the leaves from the stalks.Mint leavesMint leaves cannot be washed before storing as they tend to turn black. The leaves can be washed as and when being used for cooking. After you buy the leaves, cut their roots and put them on a kitchen towel to absorb any moisture. In the next step, wrap them in paper napkins and store in a plastic container.Curry leavesSeparate the sprigs from the bark stem. Wash them, dry them on a kitchen towel, wrap in paper napkins and store in plastic containers. Be careful not to separate the leaves from the sprigs.CauliflowerCut the leaves and large stem, and break it into florets. These florets can be stored in an airtight bag in the refrigerator. If you dont have zipped bags, put them in a plastic bag and seal it using a candle. Storing cauliflowers in this way makes sure that they dont fall prey to worms.Leafy vegetablesIn case of spinach, amaranth and other leafy vegetables, separate the leaves from the stalks, wash them, dry them, and then store in airtight bags.Onions and potatoesThese survive a long time without refrigeration, but make sure that they are kept separately and have enough breathing space. If they are kept too close to each other, dampness might grow which will ultimately cut short their shelf life.Cooked foodTalking about cooked food, chef Sakala Shankara of ITC Kakatiya says that adding any citric agent like lemon, tamarind or vinegar can increase the shelf life of food. Dishes like pulihora can stay outside for a longer time without refrigeration. In villages, they dry tomatoes and mangoes in the sun. This ensures that they have supply for a long time.Pantry Suggestions"

For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi . Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.""Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,"" Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearly Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: ""I don't have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.""Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, ""Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.""Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat 's headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works."

There are only so many trips to the fridge you can take before you give in to the inevitable monotony of your food during this quarantine period. But dont fret yet cause Monika Manchandas got your back.The popular Bengaluru-based food blogger and home baker took to her social media handles on Twitter and Instagram, last week, asking her followers to tell her whats in their pantry after requests for help with recipes flooded her inbox. I saw a lot of friends struggling with cooking and had a few panicky messages and calls, asking how to use certain ingredients that they had in their fridge. Since its such a common worry, I thought Id take this session to my social media audience as well, explains Monika. The simple question solicited an overwhelming response, she adds.Requests ranged everywhere from  what do I make with leftover pumpkin, to its my birthday in two days, how do I bake a cake without an oven? As promised, a recipe suggestion followed every query. Only have Brussel sprouts and beetroot? Make grilled Brussels sprouts with garlic, olive oil and pepper. Have a random jar of poppy seeds? Why not mix them with some oats and honey to make some snack bars? I want to do my part in helping people during this lockdown.You have these ingredients but you dont know what to do with them  thats something I can help with, she adds. Most often, the requests are for simple and comforting bowls of food that are tinted with nostalgia, she notes. As for herself, Monika admits shes staying busy and bustling during her time at home. For a lot of us, food has always been a source of comfort. Something we turn to when were down or on the other hand, something we celebrate with.Theyre intimately connected to emotions, and now that the general morale is down, its inevitable that were turning to it for comfort, says the food writer. Its a real stress buster for me, so Im chopping away in the kitchen, she adds on a lighter note. As Monika chops away, the rest of us can don our chef whites and whip up one of her recipes  a bowl of curry noodles, her go-to for a warm and straightforward meal.For recipes, visitsinamontales.com.

Ideally, they say, to cook mushrooms the best way, you should not wash them. But somehow, I am not comfortable doing that. So clean and completely dry before using. Also, cut onions and baby corninto thick slices.Heat oil in a pan and add garlic to the same. Let it brown, and then add the onions. Once the onions are soft (we dont want to cook them too much or brown them), add baby corn and cook on high flame till it starts browning.Its now time to add mushrooms. Ideally, mushrooms should be cooked separately in a wide pot with sufficient distance between them to breathe, but its okay to stir them along with the onions and baby corn. Cook till the mushrooms are done.Add in the red curry paste. If you dont have red curry paste, dont worry. Any chilli paste or hot sauce works too. You might have to adjust the quantity depending on just how spicyit is. Add in the coconut milk too and bring everything to a boil. If you like your curry noodles really saucy, increase the coconut milk and curry paste here. Actually, you can use any vegetables you have handy. Like always, I think recipes should be like canvases and we all should paintour mind in them"

Similarly, potato was auctioned for Rs15-23 per kg as against Rs12-22 per kg last time.Some traders from Kerala and Tamil Nadu supplied the produce to neighbouring states. Also, police are not restricting goods transport. Thus, traders from other cities, too, are coming to the market. As a result, there was better demand for onion today, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of the onion and potato division of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard, adding that a bulk of the produce came from Baramati, Daund and Shirur tehsils.In the fruit market, the supply of mango increased significantly.

The market received maximum mangoes from Ratnagiri and some from Karnataka on Monday. Since mango growers are permitted to carry their produce to the market, we expect the similar arrival in the coming days, said Babasaheb Bibave, the head of the fruit division of the market.The price of apple and grapes increased marginally. A kg apple was sold for Rs90-160 as against the previous bazaar rate of Rs80-140 per kg. Grapes were sold in the range of Rs50-70 per kg. However, rates of summer fruits like orange, watermelon and musk melon have remained stable, Bibave added.The price of edible oil dropped on Monday after the wholesale grocery market received its surplus intake of edible oil on Monday.Its price came down to the range of Rs1,250-1,500 per can of 15 litres. In the last bazaar, the prices were in the range of Rs1,100-Rs2,400 per can. We received 27 vehicles of oil from different places on Monday and so there was immediate impact on the rates. This increased intake will ensure stable prices of the oil in the coming days in the city, said Nitin Raskar, the head of the grocery division."

While traders and transporters are facing a lot of challenges during the lockdown such as shortage of supply from other districts, drop of market price, transportation constraints, etc, this has added no less to their burdens. The revised rates of toll charges by NHAI came into effect on Monday.We are already facing shortage of lorry drivers due to coronavirus scare. Transportation cost has increased at least by Rs 3,000 - Rs 4,000 per trip. The additional charges will only increase the prices of commodities, said G Subbu, President of the Tiruchy Lorry Owners Association.The cost of vegetables has significantly increased. One kg of potato which was sold for `50 per kg now cost Rs 70-80 per kg, according to traders. The prices have drastically increased in the last couple of days. With the import varied and markets running in a non-regular manner, we have no other option but to hike the vegetables price, said Murugan, a trader at the Gandhi market.Onion price slumpsOn the contrary, onion prices dropped due to lack of export and extreme weather conditions. One kg was sold at Rs 10- Rs 15 as against Rs 40 per kg a week ago.More than 500 tonnes of onions are stuck in the warehouses. Hence, we are dumping at least 30 tonnes of onion every day as they got ruined, said Thangaraj, Secretary of Onion Whole sellers Associations. The wholesalers in the district requested the district administration to permit them to unload onions as and when they arrived and not particularly at nights as they claimed that the weather caused more damage to vegetables packed inside tarpaulin sheets."

It also decided to use idle state bus fleet to ferry essentials and perishables, and also sort out serious drinking water problems.The four-hour emergency meeting of ministers and bureaucrats discussed several critical issues related to the Covid outbreak. The bureaucracy was told to accelerate the administration, noting that development processes has slowed down since the lockdown kicked in in the last week of March. The meeting was held in response to complaints that farmers were losing vegetables and fruits as they did not have storage facilities. Yediyurappa suggested that cold storage was the only solution and that farmers be encouraged to utilise the states facilities. Farmers will also be encouraged to sell their produce to markets in other states and export it.The lockdown has particularly affected mango farmers, for whom this is the season to export to markets abroad and also to other states. It was decided that wherever there was shortage of drinking water, the government would step in to supply water on an emergency basis, and ensure that it is good quality potable water due to the fear of COVID infection.The government also decided to release excess water stored in dams to farmers, to be used for irrigation and drinking purpose. After floods caused serious damage last year, the authorities have been instructed to obtain water availability information from dams. The meeting also decided to expedite setting up of a village-level task force to deal with COVID-related issues at the local level. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda assured the chief minister that farmers would receive fertilisers at lower prices, due to the factors like a dip in international demand.Various organisations that have been granted land but have failed to use it, have been instructed to return the land to the government, especially where lease conditions have been violated. The meeting also decided to encourage domestic tourism to overcome the effects of the sharp drop in the number of international tourists due to the COVID outbreak. Online lessons will be encouraged, and teachers will be instructed to hold classes via internet and television.Banana farmers a worried lotShivamogga: Banana farmers are finding it difficult to sell their produce. They have been selling Yelakki baale for Rs 30 per kg and Pachcha baale for Rs 20 per kg, which was Rs 50-60 per kg and Rs 40 per kg respectively before the lockdown. We used to purchase from growers and sell it in Mangaluru and Udupi markets. Now, both these markets are closed, said Siddalingeshwar of Basaveshwara Mandi.Onion seed prices leave farmers in tearsWith the lockdown triggering shortage of supply of onion seeds, the prices in Mysuru region have soared. Farmers attribute it to restrictions on vehicles coming from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other states to the region. Small onion seeds, that were sold for Rs 35-40 a kilo last year, is now priced at Rs 85 per kg. Now, a farmer has to cough up Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh to grow onion on one acre.PAY HIKE FOR CONTRACT DOCTORSDoctors working on contract with the state government, who are on the frontline battling Covid-19, will receive higher remuneration. The meeting did not take up the issue of hike in the salaries off nurses,ANMs and other medical teams."

Onion prices have also come down roughly by around Rs 20 per kg.Meanwhile, the temporary closure of Delhi-Haryana border is likely to affect the supply of fruits and vegetables in the national capital, news agency PTI reported.The prices of vegetables like ladys finger, cucumber and bottle gourd might increase in the national capital as their supply from Sonipat to Azadpur Mandi is likely to get affected by up to 30% in the wake of the sealing of the Delhi-Haryana border.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said that there is some news coming from Sonipat that supply of vegetables from the neighbouring state was not being allowed in Delhi.With this, the supply of cucumber, ladys finger, bottle gourd and other vegetables from Sonipat to Azadpur Mandi may be affected by up to 30 per cent, Khan said."

You can join the fun too,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/erin-sullivans-ourgreatindoors-challenges-people-to-create-scenes-from-the-outdoors-with-whatever-they-have-at-home-you-can-join-the-fun-too/article31632516.ece,"It looks like a scene from a disaster movie: a woman dangling precariously over a canyon, with a deep drop below. Upon closer look, it becomes clear that the imposing canyon is a slice of burnt bread, and the highline from which the subject is hanging is a string of gooey cheese in this photograph by Kristen Nelson. I created a scene of me falling while highlining in a grilled cheese canyon, she says over an email interview from Los Angeles.Ziplining through a broccoli forest | Photo Credit: Kristen NelsonHer other creations include ziplining through the Costa Rican rainforest (recreated using broccoli), walking in a winter waffle land, riding through a celery forest on a cycle made of tangerine, cheese, pasta and onions, backpacking through a can-yon.These outdoorsy pictures are part of the #ourgreatindoors page started by Los Angeles-based photographer, Erin Sullivan, which challenges photography enthusiasts to shoot images recreating the outdoors with whatever they have at home.Erin SullivanErin started recreating outdoor scenes in late March and has completed more than 18 so far. The idea came about as a response to the stay-at-home order in California, USA. I have used pillows, paper bags, broccoli, sugar, paper, pancakes, cotton balls, tin foil, jello and asparagus, says Erin, confessing that each scene she creates feels equally bizarre to her. Her most quirky creations so far have been a jello lake with an asparagus forest set in a pie dish, and onion hot tubs.Onion hot tub | Photo Credit: Erin SullivanI began asking myself how I could remain creative and connected to the outdoors and travel, adds Erin, who is constantly on the move and has travelled to around 30 countries.Soon after creating the first few scenes, she felt that this could be a great project to share with her community. And that is how #ourgreatindoors started.I almost always share my behind-the-scenes images, so that people know how they are made. Under the hashtag, we have hundreds of images of what people have created, and some are super original, she says.The recreated scenes include well-known places like Death Valley and Yosemite National Park in the US, Banff National Park and Moraine Lake (Canada), the Dolomites (Italy), glaciers and ice caves of Iceland, the Amazon rainforest, and lots of other scenes depicting rivers, camping sites, ships in the ocean, Northern Lights and starry nights. Each setup and shoot can take between 10 minutes to a few hours, depending on how complex it is.Star trails | Photo Credit: Albert BakerAlbert Baker, a landscape and travel photographer based out of Las Vegas, USA, says it took him a few days to get one of his images right. The most challenging was creating star trails and trying to figure out how to do so without actually using the real stars, he says, adding, Im actually still not happy with it.Up for the challengeFor Albert, perspective is the biggest challenge and he is picky about the image. I use a wide aperture lens and use an object closer to the camera and further away... so that when I focus on the figure, the blurred effect of the surroundings creates a realistic look, making it seem like I was actually on location shooting the photo, he explains.Albert trying to create a waterfall sequence using cling wrap | Photo Credit: Albert BakerAlbert enjoys challenges, which explains why he spends time trying to create elements like fog for instance or a waterfall, to add drama to his pictures. I used a humidifier and an empty picture glass frame to create fog, and cling wrap and acrylic sheet for a waterfall with minor setting changes on the camera, he adds.Kristen NelsonBut for Kristen, who has created 19 scenes so far, her most complex work was a canoe in an Alpine lake with mountains made of Hersheys Kisses chocolate surrounding the lake. She even used dill leaves, something she had never heard of till the shoot. While editing, I tried a lot of things and ended up redoing most of it. It took me over five hours. But the challenge just made the process more engaging and the end result more rewarding, she says, adding that she can no longer look at the objects in her fridge the same way. The ideas kept flowing, so I kept creating. Its been a lot of fun, she says.While the creative process might be satisfying, what is not as fun is the part that involves cleaning up. Most of the scenes havent required me to make a huge mess, but others have for sure, says Erin.Albert BakerAlbert, who has done 17 scenes so far, has decided to take a little break, considering how messy his house gets. But he is already planning his next shoot: something from the Arches National Park. He says: What else would I be doing without it? I thank Erin for creating it. This exercise has brought back memories of being a kid again when I used to build scenes for my action figures."
13,13,2020-05-24,Wholesale veggie prices crash during lockdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wholesale-veggie-prices-crash-during-lockdown/articleshow/75927840.cms,"In the two months since the country went into lockdown, vegetable prices have crashed in wholesale markets across states. The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others."

Eid al-Fitr means festival of breaking the fast and it marks the end of 30-day Ramadan. Just like Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr starts with the sighting of the new moon, and Muslims around the world await to sight the crescent moon on Ramadan 29 or Ramadan 30 to be sure of the date. The dates for Ramadan and Eid change as per the Islamic calendar. Eid is not just a time for celebrations and feasts, but also a time when one remembers Allah and thank him for all his blessings. Zakat (charity) is offered on Eid as well as throughout Ramadan, so that we get the opportunity to share our joys with those who are less fortunate.Food is one thing that binds everyone amid festivities globally. Family and friends get together, cook traditional recipes, and enjoy the feast with all their near and dear ones. From biryani, to kebabs, sheer mal and kheer, here are a few recipes that you can make to celebrate the festival.Biryani:Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, meaning fried before cooking. There are multiple theories about how biryani came to India, after having originated in Western Asia.One legend has it that Timur, the Turk-Mongol conqueror, brought the precursor to the biryani with him when he arrived in India in 1398. An earthen pot full of rice, spices and all available meats would be buried in a hot pit. This was then dug up and served to the warriors in Timurs army.Another legend has it that the dish was first brought to the southern Malabar coast by Arab traders who were frequent visitors there. Records of a rice dish known as Oon Soru in Tamil literature have been found dating back to as early as the year 2 A.D. Oon Soru is said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf, and was used to feed military warriors.However, the most popular story traces the origins of Biryani Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahans beautiful queen who inspired the Taj Mahal.Traditionally, the dum pukht method (slow breathing oven in Persian) of cooking biryani used. In this method, the ingredients are loaded in a pot and slow cooked over charcoal, sometimes also placed on the top of the vessel to allow the dum or steam to blend all the flavours together. The pot is sealed around the edges with dough (atta) which allows the steaming meat to tenderise in its own juices while also flavouring the layers of rice.Meat or chicken is often the main ingredient in biryani, although in some coastal varieties, fish, prawns, and crabs are also used. Vegetarians too have options such as mixed veggies, soya chunks in a veg biryani. Use of rose water, sweet edible ittar and kewra water is still prevalent in biryani cooking since the medieval era.Mughlai biryani, Hyderabadi biryani, Calcutta biryani, Dindigul biryani, Lucknowi biryani, Arcot biryani, Memoni biryani, Thalassery biryani, Kampuri biryani, Tahari biryani, Beary biryani, Sindhi biryani, Bhatkali biryani, Bombay biryani, Doodh ki biryaniare the varieties that are cooked in India across regions.Almond Mixed Grain BiryaniIngredients1/2 cup Barley washed & drained, 1/2 cup Brown rice, washed & drained, 1/2 cup Pearl Millet, washed & drained, 2 tsp Ghee, 1 tsp Garlic, Chopped, 1 tbsp Ginger, Chopped, 1 tsp Green Chilli, Chopped, 1/2 cup Baby carrots, diced 1/4 cup Onion red, sliced, 1/2 tsp Salt to Taste Black Pepper, Crushed, 7 cups Vegetable stock, 1 tsp Cumin seeds , 1 tsp Chopped Coriander, 1 tsp Chopped Spring Onion, 1/4 cup AlmondsMethodHeat ghee in a large dutch oven/pot over medium heat.

15,15,2020-05-27,Haryana farmers in dismay over deep plunge in onion prices,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-in-dismay-over-deep-plunge-in-onion-prices/story-ymbxiaoGVobiq5jT5Mp8nI.html,"chandigarhUpdated: May 28, 2020 01:25 ISTOnion farmers across the state are in dismay as wholesale prices have crashed drastically and they are unable to cover the input cost amid the lack of buyers.Onion had dominated the headlines in October last year due to its skyrocketing prices, as it was sold for 100 per kg. But now, farmers are being forced to sell it for 7- 9 per kg in the absence of buyers. This has made them question the system of marketing vegetables in the country.The traders and farmers blame the Covid-19 lockdown for the fall in rates. The farmers revealed that big transporters and buyers were not showing interest in onion due to which they were unable to sell their entire produce in the local markets.In the absence of big traders due to the lockdown, we have been selling the crop to local merchants and street vendors. This is the reason why the prices have crashed to around 8 per kg from 14 per kg last year, said Raj Kumar, a trader from Pipli onion market in Kurukshetra.As per the traders, the Pipli mandi is the biggest onion market in the northern districts of Haryana and most farmers, even from Punjab, come here to sell their produce in hope of better prices. As there is no mechanism to store the produce, the farmers have no choice but to sell it even if at lower prices, said another trader Praveen Kumar, adding that there is no possibility of rise in the prices as the harvesting is in its last leg and most of the produce has already been purchased.However, the fall in prices has appalled the farmers.I sowed onion on two acres of land and yielded nearly 110 quintals per acre, hoping for handsome returns. But it was unable to fetch me even the input cost which is around 50,000 per acre, rued farmer Raj Kumar from Fatehgarh village of Yamunanagar district.Farmers also claimed that they had to purchase nurseries at higher prices this year.This year, the production cost has doubled as the farmers had to purchase onion nurseries at higher prices. Also, there has been also a dip of about 10-20 quintals in per acre yield due to untimely rainfall. Farmers have not been able to earn much so far this year, said Vijay Kumar, a farmer from of Kurukshetras Kaserla village.As per state horticulture department officials, due to the increase in the onion prices last year, the onion acreage has increased to over 36,000 hectares from 32,000 hectares and its production to around 8.77 lakh MT against the 7.80 lakh MT from last year."

(Source: File Photo) It is always good to prepare fresh onion juice. (Source: File Photo)Onion juice, though not the subject of extensive research, has become quite popular as an anti-hair fall/hair regrowth agent. It has been used as a home remedy for years now for controlling hair fall. Science has proved that sulphur, the beauty mineral, is the chief element in onion juice, which helps boost the hair growth. Onion juice also provides micro-nutrients like vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6, and potassium, explained Dr Pallavi Sule, Mumbai-based dermatologist and aesthetic physician while explaining the benefits and quick uses of this easily available home remedy.Dr Sule explained, Onion juice may boost circulation as it also contains anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Applying onion juice to the hair and scalp could increase blood supply to hair follicles, which in turn improves hair growth. Onion juice is also found useful in delaying the premature greying of hair (though there are no studies to confirm this). This is attributed to production of the enzyme catalase in the hair follicles.Follow Indian Express Covid-19 tracker for latest updatesIngesting vs applyingAs we are specifically looking for hair regrowth, topical or local application can give the desired result, rather than ingestion. There are a lot of combinations available in the market for onion juice. These are creams, hair oils, shampoos and so on. Efficacy of the formulations can be determined only by clinical trials, so one needs to pick the product carefully.It is best to use fresh onion juice. But yes, it can be prepared in small batches and refrigerated. Avoid preparing huge quantities.How to prepare onion juiceMethodChop onion and grind it in a mixer. Sieve through a muslin cloth. Store in a clean dry container and refrigerate.Tips to keep in mind*Those who have known allergy to onions, do not try onion juice on the scalp.*Onion juice can be irritable to the scalp, so its better to mix it with soothing agents like alovera/coconut oil/honey.*Increased sensitivity of the scalp to onion juice may happen after a few applications. Please contact your dermatologist if symptoms surface often.*There can be reactions between onion juice and medications, for example, aspirin.*The smell of onion juice is quite pungent. So, one can mix a few drops of essential oils to mask the smell and add value and more goodness to the onion juice. For example, tea tree oil or lavender oil among others.Kitchen remediesOnion hair maskMix two teaspoon of extracted onion juice with one teaspoon of honey. This mask can be applied 15-20 mins before you wash your hair. It promotes hair growth and adds lustre and shine to hair shafts. It also reduces inflammation on the scalp, reduces dandruff or any scalp infection.Onion juice mixed with caster oilMix equal quantities of each and apply on the scalp one hour before you bathe. This is an excellent combination as both ingredients help in hair regrowth plus have similar anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(File Photo) A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with. (File Photo)The Pune Municipal Corporation has sought the expertise of police investigators in the use of technology for tracing the likely contacts of a person declared infected with the COVDI-19 disease.Rahul Jagtap, incharge of information technology wing at the PMC, said these days crime investigation relies heavily on technology, and police teams are very skilled at tracing the whereabouts and the likely contacts of a criminal.We are exploring whether those same skills of the police can be used in tracing the persons who might have come in contact with a person infected with Coronavirus. We have shared the mobile phone number of some of the infected people in the city with the cyber crime cell for assistance in tracing their contacts, he said.A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with, especially in the case of people who start showing symptoms only after a few days.It is noticed that many infected persons do not show symptoms initially and freely move around. They are tested and confirmed as positive cases, only after they show symptoms after a few days. In such cases, contact tracing gets very difficult. But we also have to ensure that no possible case of spread of the virus is left out, the officer said.Vegetable prices soar as markets closed till March 31On a day when markets in the city were shut except those dealing in essential commodities, prices of vegetables skyrocketed on Monday amid high demand and shrinking supply.Traders and vendors said people were panic shopping created by the fear of shutdown, following the spread of COVID-19.Onion, potato, green vegetables, coriander, green chillies were sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 more than the rates they were being sold until the weekend.The supply of vegetables has gone down while the demand is high, as people are purchasing in large quantities, said an official from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) that runs Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard.Taking advantage of the situation, local vendors too have hiked the vegetable prices. The rates of one kilogram of most vegetables in suburban area remained anywhere between Rs 50 and Rs 90 on Monday.A vendor at Chinchwad said, I will need to replenish my stocks twice a week, but this time, my stocks lasted only for a day. Many customers purchased in bulk.The otherwise bustling Pimpri market wore a deserted look Monday. Most stall owners were seen packing up the leftover vegetables, soon after the orders of closure came in.

18,18,2020-04-09,Cost of essentials spike amid lockdown in Odisha,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2020/apr/09/cost-of-essentials-spike-amid-lockdown-in-odisha-2127776.html,"By Express News ServiceJEYPORE: With the lockdown affecting transportation of commodities, price of grocery items and vegetables has skyrocketed in Koraput district. In fact, prices of daily requirements like wheat, pulses, potatoes, onions and edible oil are differing from one market to another.While all vegetables are selling beyond Rs 40 per kg, cost of edible oil in retail units is Rs100 per litre and that of pulses is Rs90 per kg. Onions are selling at Rs 33 per kg. All the commodities were selling at 15 per cent less than the existing rates prior to the lockdown. Considering that all vegetables except onions and potatoes are grown in Koraput, the price rise has come as a shocker to locals.When we buy from retail shops, the vendors give us at least 10 per cent discount but now they are giving any rebate because of poor supply of commodities from other states, said Rajiv Mishra, a resident of Jeypore town. He added that even green leafy vegetables are being sold at Rs15 to Rs20 per bundle.Sources in Jeypore Chamber of Commerce and Industries said the price rise is due to hike in transportation cost. There is adequate stock of essential commodities in the market but the price is high now as wholesalers have to pay more for transporting them from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal, reasoned secretary of the Jeypore Chamber of Commerce and Industries, V Pravakar. Similar is the case with vegetables which are being brought to urban areas from villages.District Civil Supply Officer TR Nayak, assured to regulate the prices and check hoarding."
19,19,2020-06-13,Queen of rasam,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/rasam-queen-usha-prabhakaran-is-ready-to-launch-her-rasam-digest-that-has-1000-rasam-recipes/article31820896.ece,"No other Indian dish can claim to have medicinal value in each of its ingredients. That honour belongs to the humble rasam (meaning: essence). No wonder, then, that rasam has emerged as the most popular dish during COVID-19 lockdown.Apart from being the simplest dish, one can prepare rasam with minimal ingredients, and it can be had as soup or mixed with rice and eaten. But preparing rasam requires knowledge, expertise and experience, says 64-year-old Usha Prabhakaran, author of the soon-to-be-launched Rasam Digest, a book with 1,000 different rasam recipes.A lawyer by profession, Usha shot to fame in 1998, when her Pickle Digest, a book with 1,000 pickle recipes, was published. Actually, I collected almost 3000 recipes but I had to pick 1000 [for the book], says Usha, who got the Pickle Queen moniker soon after. Over time, I have developed the knack of extracting recipes from anyone and everyone I come across, adds Usha, who credits her mother-in-law, Chandra Lakshmi, for lighting her passion for cooking, who at the age of 83 still actively engages herself in cooking as well as shopping for ingredients. The nuances I learnt from her but the numerous tips and tricks I gathered over a period of time, Usha says.The book has sections like Modest Pleasures (rasam from plant stems, leaves and rind-based), Hard to Resist Residual Wonder (rasam made with the residue of chutney or thogayal) and Quick Serves (instant rasam), Dynamic Diet, Heritage Sustenance, Physician at your Door, Dazzling Superstars, among others.Achieving critical massFor a perfect rasam, balancing the tamarind (sourness), adding spices and seasoning, which helps lock the flavour in, is critical. Sourness can be derived from tamarind, tomato, sour buttermilk or just dal water, says Usha, adding that rasam fits everyones budget, can be prepared with minimal ingredients, or if one or two of the basic ingredients are not available. Basic ingredients can be interchanged if one is unavailable, like moong dal can be swapped for toor dal. The dish can be prepared, tasted and changed to your desired taste all through the process of cooking. Most importantly, it is a medicinal preparation that plays a significant role throughout an individuals life from birth to old age, says Usha, adding, Which is why I have dedicated a section in the book to age-appropriate rasams, titled Birth to Adulthood.Rasam can be made out of almost anything. Have you ever tasted pea peel rasam, or betel leaf rasam? How about jamoon rasam? Did you know that we can make rasam using jackfruit seed, watermelon rind, kodukkapuli, hibiscus flower and bamboo shoot?, she asks.Even peels and plant stems, which are usually discarded, can be used. When we were in Kerala, our domestic helper used to collect banana peels and take it home. Out of curiosity, I asked her what she would do with them, and that is how I learnt to make banana peel rasam. Similarly, keera thandu, murunga keera and agathi keera lend themselves well for the dish. Rasam made with stems of mint, coriander and curry leaves will taste heavenly, says Usha.Kicking up flavoursIngredients to garnish ought to be added to ghee in a particular order. Once the ladle is hot with oil, add the urad. When it turns light brown and gives out aroma, add the mustard. As it starts to splutter, add red chillies, fenugreek seeds, cumin and curry leaves (in that order) and then pour it over the rasam. Thaalippu or garnish is the crown, so it has to be perfect, she says. If it gets burnt, just discard it and redo. In some families, they sprinkle a little water after garnishing and this is to lock the flavour.Ushas rasam podi recipe:Ingredients200 gms each of Tanjore (gundu), Salem (neetu) and Bedige chillies600 gms coriander seeds200 gms each of pepper, jeera and fenugreek1/4 of LG asafoetida bar6 to 10 turmeric sticks10 sprigs of sun-dried curry leaves2 large fistfuls toor dal1 fistful moong dal (optional)1 fistful urad dal1 fistful channa dalMethodSun-dry the ingredients and grind them to medium coarse in a mill.While assembling the dish, crushing curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves together with crystal salt and tamarind water brings out the best flavour. A slit green chilli and a blob of jaggery enhance the taste, she adds. Usha also notes that rasam is best made using an eeya chombu (a vessel made out of tin-aluminium alloy that has a broad base and narrow neck), clay pot or soapstone pot.The eeya chombu is designed in such a manner that the aroma and flavour rotate within the vessel when it is mixed with a ladle, she says, adding a word of caution, Never use cast iron to make rasam. Another important trick is assembling the rasam. You got to crush curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves with crystal salt along with tamarind water to get that magical taste and flavour, and this comes with practice.Usha has listed wide range of rasam podi recipes in her book. Now coming to rasam podi, Usha insists that sun drying all the ingredients will result in aromatic rasam. The rule can be relaxed and ingredients roasted in a pan only during rainy days. Depending on usage, rasam podi can be stored for upto six months. Another reason why some never get it right is they might let the preparation boil over and this might ruin the flavour. When it is about to boil, switch off, garnish and close immediately. Use only ghee for garnishing as ghee acts as the vehicle for absorbing the goodness of the spices used. And the rasam connoisseur that she is, she insists she has prepared each of the 1,000 rasams in her book at least five times.The book is targeted at Indian and international audiences, and has a detailed description of all 350 ingredients with a photograph, its medicinal value, taste and usage. I have also provided tips on how to buy and store these ingredients.Adirasam delightA rasam connoisseur would always go for Adi rasam or the mandi, which is nothing but what settles at the bottom of the vessel. Once you understand the value of mandi, you will never miss it. The best way to serve rasam is to give it a good mix with a ladle and then serve it.Regional fareThe herbal concoction predominantly made in Southern states is called Rasam in Tamil Nadu. Chaaru in Andhra and Saaru in Konkan and Karnataka, the preparation usually an everyday affair is an essential part of the South Indian cusine.Seasonal RasamGita Rajamani, a food blogger whose You Tube channel, Agrahara Recipes, documents tradtional vegetarian recipes handed over from generations says that each of the spices has healing properties and is essentially facts as an immunity booster. Rasam preparation in households depends on the season, for example during the rainy season Jeera Milagu Rasam and Milagu rasam is the staple.During the Covid 19 crisis, the septuagenarian recommends Kandanthippili and Sadakuppai rasam, which is a remedy for fever, cold and cough. As it is easily digestible, rasam is suitable for people of all age groups, and for diabetic population, she recommends Goddu rasam or the mild rasam with minimal ingredients and buttermilk rasam.Nutritious Konkani SaaruFood blogger Divya Kudua, who specialises in Kerala and Konkani cuisine, says that in Kerala rasam never takes the centrestage, but is always a mild concoction made using jeera and pepper, usually served as an after meal digestive drink. In Konkani cuisine Saaru is prepared using the tamarind, dal and coconut.Usually on Fridays we make Channa water rasam, which is more like a soup and not necessarily mixed with rice and eaten. Saaru as we call it, is a nutritious dish suitable for all age groups, says Divya.Instagram@divyakuduaRaw, no fuelIn Andhra and Telangana region, there are numerous variations of Chaaru (rasam). Depending on the region, the ingredients that goes into this spiced up broth varies, says Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad.. He observes that the usage of garlic is high in these states, and more red chillies are used in the place of pepper corns. Considered a poor mans food, the dishs highlight is the garnishing, he says.His favorite is the Pacchi Pulusu, which does not require cooking and is raw. Pacchi pulusu can be prepared in a jiffy, and the most important aspect is the mixing of all the ingredients in the tamarind water with ones handsIngredients:100 grams Tamarind25 grams Green chilli00 grams Onion10 grams Curry leaves10 grams Coriander leaves10 grams Jaggery25 ml Oil10 grams Cumin seeds10 grams Dry red chilliSalt to taste500 ml WaterMethod: Soak tamarind for 30 minutes in water, squeeze and extract the pulp.

Well, Lassis of India  Smoothies with a Twist, Radha Bhatias debut book, contains such eclectic recipes concerning one of Indias famous cold beverages. No wonder then, the book bagged an award in the 'Drinks with No Alcohol' category at the coveted Gourmand World Award 2020.Lassis of India is as much a result of this travel and trade entrepreneurs passion for cooking and concern for health as it is of her urge to pass on the Indian healthy delights she enjoyed growing up to the younger generation, heavily influenced by the Western culture.The book begins with 'Panchamrit', followed by 17 traditional lassi recipes Bhatia collected combing the length and breadth of India; each with its unique taste and health benefits. The other 57 recipes are the modern derivatives  lassis with a twist.Interestingly, the idea for this book germinated at the dining table two years ago. ""We had just finished our breakfast when I told my grandchildren, let us make some mango lassi. They made a funny face and said, we don't like lassi. A little while later I told them lets make mango smoothie and they got all excited.That set her thinking. A trifle sad about the Indian culture and tradition being diminished with the angreziyat, she decided to bring out a book exclusively on Indian smoothies  lassis.Her initial research into the world of lassis led her to understand that a regions climate, availability of the ingredients and food habits determine the ingredients in each variety of this chill concoction. Her roundup of 17 traditional recipes includes the Punjabi 'Meethi Lassi' and 'Talicha More' of Tamil Nadu.The book is also treasure house for interesting trivia like kitchen secrets, Indian cultural roots, local customs, climate, and cuisines. Each recipe recounts a small story, which makes the book interesting. Whenever we complained about having a headache, my grandmother would give us warm milk with jalebi in it, and the headache would go away. The book also has my grandmothers picture, says Bhatia, recounting the backstory behind Jalebi Lassi.A major issue Bhatia faced with Lassis of India when she took the book to publishers. They needed at least 200 pages while mine fitted into 30. That was when I decided to include some modern versions. So the 57 'modern' recipes you see in the book are all my preparations, says Bhatia.Drinking lassi, she says, in these times is very important. A lassi has a lot of spices and herbs, which increases the bodys immunity. Being freshly prepared and consumed, it doesn't contain harmful preservatives, and apart from being tasty is also healthy, she says, adding that the simple-to-follow recipes are for those who love to cook.I hope to pass on this priceless legacy to the new generation and help them live a healthier life, says Bhatia, now planning her next book. She reveals that the upcoming one will also be on the lines of cooking and healthy eating."

Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week."

However, the rush among people to stock up on essentials continued.Most fish sellers, too, were missing from the markets. And those who came to the markets on Friday chose to sell very little variety and depended mostly on ocal produce, not the ones supplied from other states or from districts. Frequent lockdowns seemed to have snapped the supply chain adversely.The price of potatoes increased further. While the Jyoti variety was sold for Rs 32 across the city, Chandramukhi touched Rs 36 on Friday. Most sellers had, however, brought out the smaller varieties of these potatoes sold at a slightly lower price. Onions remained a sore point even on Friday as its price hovered between Rs 30-35, though the fresh quality was yet to be seen in the market till now. Traders blamed the lack of supply. The price of ginger went through the roof in most of the markets as people are consuming it to keep cough and cold at bay. Around 100g ginger was sold for Rs 30, the price went up by Rs 12-15.Monsoons is at its peak but good quality of hilsa hasnt arrived in the market yet. The katla and rohu were being sold for Rs 550 and Rs 250 a kilo (whole/half). I did not buy as those fish were not of my choice. I also argued with some fish sellers who did not wear masks.

The bulb is set to become a prized possession with the monsoon playing spoilsport traders say the price of this kitchen essential is due to go sharp north in the days ahead, while the quality will nosedive.They blame the monsoon, flooding and poor inter-state coordination for this. Onion traders say that a kilo of onion, which cost Rs 10, almost doubled during the festive period, after the lockdown was eased and markets were opened. But now the price is likely to shoot up further.At present, 1kg of onion costs Rs 20-30, depending on the size, and is likely to escalate to Rs 40-50; in some places, a superior grade of the bulb costs Rs 50, and could go up to Rs 80. During the festival season, though cost was rising, we didnt escalate the price too much as we feared we would lose whatever little business we were getting after the lockdown was lifted.But now we will be forced to sell at a high price if there is poor supply, said a trader. C Udayshankar, secretary of the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Yeshwantpur, said that most of the retailers did not hike prices during the festival, but now costs are set to rise. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Maharashtra has damaged standing crops.So far, the onion coming from Maharashtra is old stock, and will not last long. The new stock will be moist and have more water content, making them difficult to store for long, he said. Last year too, consumers, farmers and traders had faced a similar situation, where onion quality had dipped and cost was high. Apart from Maharashtra, heavy rain and flooding in North Karnataka will also lead to a price escalation. The picture will be clear after a fortnight, when new stock starts coming in. The stock arriving from Maharashtra is of poor quality and there is no new produce from Karnataka so far, he added."

And this decision has made people think of resuming their exercise regime and getting back into shape. While exercise is the most important to stay fit, a well-balanced diet also plays a very crucial role. For as they say, we are what we eat.Although wed all love to lose weight while not compromising on what we eat, such isnt the case. However, a few simple lifestyle changes and alterations in food habits can work wonders for us, say experts.Nuts is something nutritionist Tripti Tandon swears by: Almonds have the ability to cut down cravings, and also help in weight loss. Yogurt is also a very good superfood. You can add oatmeal, granola or fruits and make it a healthy bowl. You can even add berries, which are rich in antioxidants, as well as nuts, making for a healthy meal. Legumes such as black and red rajma, kala chana, soyabeans are excellent sources of protein, fibre and iron. You can make a chaat out of kala chana or rajma, as it also helps boost immunity.Nuts are a nutritional way to settle those hunger pangs ( Photo: Shutterstock )Have lots of green leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, etc), as they are rich in vitamins and calcium. Also, olive oil can be used, as it is rich in good fatty acids. Whole grains are also very good, as they are rich in vitamins and minerals, and lower cholesterol in the body. Onions, tomatoes and garlic are also superfoods, she says.However, Tandon cautions that no matter how healthy, anything in excess is not good. Insisting on portion control, she also suggests wrapping up dinner early. If you are hungry later, you could have a fruit, some nuts, any herbal tea or a small cup of milk with cocoa, she adds.A key factor for weight gain during the lockdown, according to Ritika Samaddar, a senior dietitian, is binge eating and excessive snacking. We must get back into a disciplined life. During the lockdown, people were getting up late, skipping breakfast, opting for a heavy brunch, etc. Since everyone was at home, people were cooking all sorts of dishes. Therefore, it is important to keep a check on snacking. Opt for healthier options like walnuts, sprouts or a bowl of fruits. Carry a smoothie, as you need a good amount of probiotic. Also, when youre moving out of home, hydration becomes key. Carry detox water, chaach or fresh lime. Also, carry home-cooked food, as when you eat out, you consume unhealthy calories, she adds.Theres nothing quite like a healthy smoothie bowl, to satiate our taste buds ( HT Photo )Samaddar also asserts that people should have breakfast within two hours of waking up. The food that you have for breakfast is also important. It has to be a combination of carbohydrates with proteins. You could start your day with some lukewarm water with honey. You could also opt for ginger water, lemon water, or kadha, she adds.READ: Feeling sluggish? You might be dehydrated!However, in addition to controlling our diet, it is also important to practise mindful eating, says Preeti Rao, a health and wellness expert. Become an intuitive eater. Most people are not connected with their hunger. For example, a baby eats only when it is hungry, and only as much as it needs, with no indulgence. As we grow up, we become less intuitive of our hunger and land up eating just for taste or managing our emotions. Make sure you activate all the sensory organs when you eat. In other words, watch you food, taste your food, smell your food and observe how the food makes you feel in your body. This can happen only if we eat in peace and not with our televisions on or while looking into our phones, she opines.Rao also recommends opting for seasonal produce. Every season brings with it various fruits and vegetables. With increased genetically modified foods, we now have access to our favourite fruits or vegetables all through the seasons. Seasonal fruits and vegetables have properties that suit the climate we are in. For example, summer fruits have more water, which cools the body down. Be educated about the produce you are eating, she suggests.Author tweets @srinidhi_gkFor more stories follow Facebook and Twitter"
