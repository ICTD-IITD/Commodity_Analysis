(File photo)NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Are onions still wreaking havoc on your monthly budget? For once, supply issues are not to blame, with around 50 trucks of onions coming in from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Azadpur Mandi every day, each bringing in around 20 tonnes of the essential commodity.The reason why they continue to cost you a bomb then is the high retail and wholesale price differential in Delhi. While the wholesale price currently ranges between Rs 15/kg and Rs 25/kg, retailers are selling onions for anywhere between Rs 40/kg and Rs 60/kg. Usually, sellers keep a margin of Rs 15/kg to account for transportation, storage and other costs. A 100% margin, which even some traders find hard to explain, is biting consumers hard.In Nashik, which is Delhis biggest supplier, the average wholesale price has steadily dropped over the last few weeks. To put things in perspective, it was Rs 1,600/quintal on Friday, a drop of 40% from Rs 2,600/quintal on January 31. The average wholesale price had touched an all-time high of Rs 8,625/quintal on December 16 last year at Lasalgaon APMC, the countrys largest wholesale onion market. Since then, the prices has dropped almost 81%.In the past fortnight, the drop is nearly 64%  from Rs 4,100/quintal on January 20.This decline, however, is yet to reflect in the retail markets of Delhi. In terms of kilograms, when the wholesale price ranged between Rs 60 and Rs 100 from mid-December to mid-January, individual consumers were buying it for anywhere between Rs 80/kg and Rs 120/kg. On Friday, at the roadside stalls near Mata Sundri College in New Delhi, onions were being sold at Rs 50/kg. Similarly, in east Delhis Samaspur, the retail price was between Rs 55/kg and Rs 60/kg. Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller in Samaspur F Block, said the prices had come down by Rs 30-40/kg in a month. Its gradually going down, he claimed.In south Delhis Vasant Kunj, too, the current retail price hovered around Rs 50/kg.Rajan Pal, a seller at Bhogal vegetable market, said at Rs 55, the commodity was far cheaper than it was a couple of months ago when a kilogram cost above Rs 100. . We get onions from Afghanistan and other countries too, but people prefer the Indian version, he said.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, found the high wholesale-retail price differential surprising. There is no shortage of supply in the wholesale market. But the retail prices are much higher than usual, he said, adding that the retail prices were decided by the retailers. The economics of demand and supply determines the prices in the retail markets and there is no mechanism to control them. Factors like location and quality of the product play their part too: in upscale colonies, the retail prices are typically higher.Pintu Mandal, a seller at a market in Govindpuri, said onions were going as high as Rs 60/kg as the wholesale price was still steep. He attributed this to many wholesalers hoarding stocks with an eye on a dip in supply later.According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, there has been a rise in production in all onion-growing pockets of the country in the last one month, but the demand has remained in the same territory as earlier. This has led to a drop in the average wholesale price. Production is good in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu too. This has led to a drop in demand for Maharashtras onions. As a result, the average wholesale onion price has dropped, Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC, said. She said a continuous fluctuations in the wholesale price were also responsible for the selling price not stabilising. The Centre had yet to lift the stock limit on wholesale and onion traders, which had been cut from 50 tonnes to 25 tonnes for wholesalers and from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes for retailers, Jagtap said.The government needs to lift the restrictions on onion traders  both wholesalers and retailers, she added.A source in the Union ministry of agriculture, however, denied that there was any control over retail prices. Some retailers have already purchased onions from the wholesale market and are releasing these gradually. This is the reason for the wide gap. The retail prices will drop gradually, he said."

The price had spiked because of excess rain, which ruined the crop in several parts of the country.With supply stabilising, especially from Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, and exports banned, the rate is now easing, officials said.Consumers may be smiling but farmers are worried as they are not able to make more than Rs 17/kg as against the expected Rs 40.""We get onions from Nasik and Sholapur in Maharashtra. Nasik onions used to be exported but since that is currently banned, they are landing in Bengaluru, leaving the market here with a surplus,"" said K Lokesh, president, Karnataka State Onion Merchants Association.A farmer from Sholapur wh o was part of a onion growers' delegation which met traders in Bengaluru, said, ""The cost of everything has gone up.

Retail prices ranged between Rs 25-35 a kilo in the city on Thursday.Arrival of fresh stock is cited as reason for the slump in price. While consumers are happy, traders complain they were staring at losses as they had invested a lot earlier to procure from other States and even abroad.Wholesale traders have requested the Union government to lift the ban on export which is in place since last year.Due to inclement weather, onion cultivation dropped drastically in the State. This resulted in demand skyrocketing and sent prices on an upward spiral.Despite all efforts by the government, the price shot up to as much as Rs 160 a kilo.Grappling with supply chain, the Union government-imposed ban on exports in September 2019 till prices returned to normal. According to onion traders, while the daily requirement for onions is 600 tonnes,less than 50 per cent of it used to arrive in the market. To meet demand, onions were imported from Turkey and Egypt.A Thangaraj, secretary, Tiruchy Onion Wholesalers Association, said, Prices stood above Rs 100 per kg for almost six months, as a result of which sales was affected. With the arrival of harvest season, there is now steady supply, which led to the price drop. Since there is a export ban, cultivated onions from across the state are arriving in markets. Supply now exceeds demand. To handle the situation, the Union government must lift the ban on onion exports."

5,5,2020-03-04,Onion prices expected to rise in Gujarat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/onion-prices-expected-to-rise-as-union-govt-lifts-export-ban/articleshow/74466072.cms,"Picture used for representational purpose onlyRAJKOT: Onion prices are likely to upset budgets of families again.After embargo on exports imposed last year in wake of skyrocketing prices, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has allowed the free export of all varieties of onion from India beginning March 15. The notification issued by the DGFT on March 2 comes following representations from various marketing yards and farmer bodies including Mahuva marketing yard to the union minister of agriculture last month.Traders believe that the onion prices in local markets are likely to increase as a result of export and the crop arrival this year has already been delayed by two months due to prolonged inclement weather last year.In Bhavnagar and Mahuva yard, onion selling at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per 20 kg shot up Rs 470 two days before the news came in that government was likely to allow the export.Narendra Gohil, an onion trader in Bhavnagar yard said, When exports start, we are expect rise in price. At present, onions from Nashik market are pouring in domestic market. One exports begin, the demand for the Mahuva quality onion will increase in domestic market.The government of India had banned onion export on September 29 last year after the prices crossed Rs 150 per kg in retail market. Amreli and Bhavnagar are the two biggest onion producing districts in Gujarat.The normal season for the onion production is January and February, but this year the harvest has been delayed due to prolonged monsoon.According to agriculture department data, the onion sowing area increased to 39,000 hecatre in Gujarat in current financial year from 25,000 ha last year. However the yield is likely to decrease by 30% this year. The onion flood yards during the peak season, but this year we dont expect much yield because of some disease also, Gohil added.Currently, 15,000 bags (each containing 50kg) are coming for auction in Bhavnagar and Mahuva yards. Every year during peak season, 1.50 lakh bags are brought for auction. This year, traders expect around 60,000 to 75,000 bags daily.Vitthal Koradia, an onion exporter said, Generally, the onion crop comes in winter, but this year when the peak season arrives in April, the temperature will be high, which will damage the crop.Ghanshyam Patel, secretary, Mahuva marketing yard said, On February 5, we had represented to the union agriculture minister to allow export."

Order NowPUNE: Onion was auctioned in the range of Rs8-17 per kg at Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday  the first instance of its wholesale price dipping below the double-figure since the beginning of the ongoing season in January.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials attributed the slump in the onions wholesale price to dip in demand for the produce. Also, they pointed out that the commission agents, who facilitate auction of the farm produce, opened their shops after a break of two weeks. As such, the intake of fresh onion was high in the market.A total of 11,534 quintals of onion arrived in Gultekdi yard on Wednesday. This was more than expected and hence, the prices fell sharply in the open auction, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of vegetables, fruits, onion and potato division of the market yard.He said, Usually, hoteliers and other eateries in the city buy a bulk of onions, but these establishments are closed because of the lockdown. So, there wasnt much demand for onion in the open auction, which drove the price down to the seasons lowest so far. The onions sold at Rs8 per kg was of low standard. But till date, even this type of onion was being sold above Rs12 per kg.The APMC officials claimed that there was adequate supply of kitchen staple, but retail vendors were selling the produce at high price. Outside market yard, vendors are selling onion for anything between Rs35 and Rs40 per kg. People need not worry about the intake or supply at least for next four weeks, Kalamkar said.The wholesale price of potato also took a dip from Rs22-25 per kg two days back to Rs20-22 per kg on Wednesday with 15,281 quintals of potato arriving in the market. The arrival was a surplus, the APMC officials stated.Maximum potato is purchased by vada pav or pav bhaji vendors, which are closed these days. We expect further fall in prices in the coming days, Kalamkar added.The five sub-markets across the city, too, received surplus onion and potato supplies.Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of AFMC, appealed to farmers and commission agents not to bring produce in a large number as only 400 vehicles of vegetables are permitted nowadays every day.Maintaining social distance and avoiding mass gathering is necessary in the current situation. If we get more than 400 vehicles, the market would be crowded and following or implementing the government guidelines would be impossible, Deshmukh said."

While traders and transporters are facing a lot of challenges during the lockdown such as shortage of supply from other districts, drop of market price, transportation constraints, etc, this has added no less to their burdens. The revised rates of toll charges by NHAI came into effect on Monday.We are already facing shortage of lorry drivers due to coronavirus scare. Transportation cost has increased at least by Rs 3,000 - Rs 4,000 per trip. The additional charges will only increase the prices of commodities, said G Subbu, President of the Tiruchy Lorry Owners Association.The cost of vegetables has significantly increased. One kg of potato which was sold for `50 per kg now cost Rs 70-80 per kg, according to traders. The prices have drastically increased in the last couple of days. With the import varied and markets running in a non-regular manner, we have no other option but to hike the vegetables price, said Murugan, a trader at the Gandhi market.Onion price slumpsOn the contrary, onion prices dropped due to lack of export and extreme weather conditions. One kg was sold at Rs 10- Rs 15 as against Rs 40 per kg a week ago.More than 500 tonnes of onions are stuck in the warehouses. Hence, we are dumping at least 30 tonnes of onion every day as they got ruined, said Thangaraj, Secretary of Onion Whole sellers Associations. The wholesalers in the district requested the district administration to permit them to unload onions as and when they arrived and not particularly at nights as they claimed that the weather caused more damage to vegetables packed inside tarpaulin sheets."

It also decided to use idle state bus fleet to ferry essentials and perishables, and also sort out serious drinking water problems.The four-hour emergency meeting of ministers and bureaucrats discussed several critical issues related to the Covid outbreak. The bureaucracy was told to accelerate the administration, noting that development processes has slowed down since the lockdown kicked in in the last week of March. The meeting was held in response to complaints that farmers were losing vegetables and fruits as they did not have storage facilities. Yediyurappa suggested that cold storage was the only solution and that farmers be encouraged to utilise the states facilities. Farmers will also be encouraged to sell their produce to markets in other states and export it.The lockdown has particularly affected mango farmers, for whom this is the season to export to markets abroad and also to other states. It was decided that wherever there was shortage of drinking water, the government would step in to supply water on an emergency basis, and ensure that it is good quality potable water due to the fear of COVID infection.The government also decided to release excess water stored in dams to farmers, to be used for irrigation and drinking purpose. After floods caused serious damage last year, the authorities have been instructed to obtain water availability information from dams. The meeting also decided to expedite setting up of a village-level task force to deal with COVID-related issues at the local level. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda assured the chief minister that farmers would receive fertilisers at lower prices, due to the factors like a dip in international demand.Various organisations that have been granted land but have failed to use it, have been instructed to return the land to the government, especially where lease conditions have been violated. The meeting also decided to encourage domestic tourism to overcome the effects of the sharp drop in the number of international tourists due to the COVID outbreak. Online lessons will be encouraged, and teachers will be instructed to hold classes via internet and television.Banana farmers a worried lotShivamogga: Banana farmers are finding it difficult to sell their produce. They have been selling Yelakki baale for Rs 30 per kg and Pachcha baale for Rs 20 per kg, which was Rs 50-60 per kg and Rs 40 per kg respectively before the lockdown. We used to purchase from growers and sell it in Mangaluru and Udupi markets. Now, both these markets are closed, said Siddalingeshwar of Basaveshwara Mandi.Onion seed prices leave farmers in tearsWith the lockdown triggering shortage of supply of onion seeds, the prices in Mysuru region have soared. Farmers attribute it to restrictions on vehicles coming from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other states to the region. Small onion seeds, that were sold for Rs 35-40 a kilo last year, is now priced at Rs 85 per kg. Now, a farmer has to cough up Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh to grow onion on one acre.PAY HIKE FOR CONTRACT DOCTORSDoctors working on contract with the state government, who are on the frontline battling Covid-19, will receive higher remuneration. The meeting did not take up the issue of hike in the salaries off nurses,ANMs and other medical teams."

Wholesale traders and brokers have been asked to send essentials procured from farmers to Mumbai markets directly, bypassing the Vashi APMC to ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted due to the shutdown of the markets.The decision to shut all five markets was taken after the stakeholders like traders, brokers, transporters and workers expressed unwillingness to work fearing risk to their lives after a spike in number of positive cases reported from APMC market yard in the last few days. A meeting of top bureaucrats was held on Friday at the APMC market to decide the line of action. Various traders bodies also wrote to the APMC administration to shut the market.The decision to shut the market came as a preventive measure as thousands flock the wholesale market daily. Earlier, the Navi Mumbai mayor Jayawant Sutar, NMMC administrator Annasaheb Misal, local MLA Ganesh Naik had demanded closure of APMC immediately in view of rising number of corona cases as the wholesale market has become the corona hotspot in the city.According to APMC sources, a review will be conducted on May 15 to check that whether the situation is conducive to restart the market. APMC deputy secretary Krishnakant Pawar said, During the shutdown we will conduct sanitisation and disinfection of the whole market premises, before the review date. Presently, most of the traders are sending essentials directly to Mumbai and the remaining should follow suit. APMC director Sanjay Pansare said, Screening of all the stakeholders is the need of the hour."

His Hyderabad-based enterprise, Kiaro Foods, which started as a dairy production and delivery brand, remodelled itself into a farm-to-home service, within a week of the lockdown. The app-based brand has been able to supply seasonal vegetables and fruits, including much-coveted mangoes during the lockdown.Kiaro Farms setups for bringing fresh produce to different parts of Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath shares, Letting good produce that wasnt going out of Telangana rot seemed like not only a waste but also meant we werent utilising our existing logistics the right way. After much thought we redesigned our app and introduced same-day harvested vegetables. The re-branding exercise was driven by the need to help farmers, so that their hard work and produce would not go waste. In the process, ledgers and accounts have gone for a toss, as they focussed on sourcing and logistics as the lockdown came as a bolt from the blue.A young woman with her selection of fresh produce and baked goods from Kiaro Foods, Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath says, At first, we sourced and sold produce without grading; we are not very proud about that. However, we learnt from our mistakes and reworked the system and started grading the vegetables and fruits. Then we sourced eggs from an exporter and started selling them through the app. Soon we realised there was a huge demand for bread, wheat, fruits. We literally rebuilt ourselves on the basis of demand. Our motive was to make sure people get what they need. The breads we supply are from an upscale confectionery thats known for its desserts; the wheat is also from an exporter who had a big amount of fresh wheat that couldnt be exported due to lockdown.Prabalika M BorahHobby turns into needThe Prodigal Farms, NoidaPuneet Tyagi and Neha Bhatia started farming as a hobby four years ago, and soon turned it into a business, first with farm-to-fork weekend experiences and zero-waste workshops, and now with home delivery of their produce that is free of inorganic additives. We have six farmers working with us, four of whom are women. Their husbands lost their jobs, and so came to the farm; we were able to employ them to deliver the produce, says Puneet. He says the vegetables are harvested and packed into boxes by the farmers and they would be loaded and delivered by another set of people, ensuring minimal handling.Initially, they needed to realign deliveries only to Noida, but have now worked out a system of delivering across Delhi-NCR (theprodigalfarms.com/farmstore). Because orders had drastically reduced, and they had a lot of produce, they began making home processed foods like pickle, which people can order. Puneet says the lockdown has helped bring the farmers in the neighbourhood together and many have shown an interest in halting the use of artificial pesticide and fertilizer.Sunalini MathewFarm platformKrishi Cress, Chattarpur and FaridabadAchintya Anand, a chef and first-generation farmer, began five years ago, by supplying produce to restaurants and hotels. The lockdown saw demand from the hospitality sector dip to almost nothing.Within a week or so of operation, the website, orders.krishicress.com, which had been ready, went up for home-delivery orders. We had been trying it out for a year, but we had a small presence, says Achintya. Now, orders have doubled, but the cost of logistics poses a challenge. Also, there are two farms, in Chattarpur and Faridabad, so coordinating transportation has not been easy. Another challenge has been maintaining hygiene protocols and implementing changes overnight.We are very lucky because a lot of our staff stay at the farm, so theres minimal contact from the outside; the rest all live close by. Also, as we are located in a remote area, we had started a pick-up and drop facility before the first lockdown, he says.What remains popular are his salad and microgreens, as well as the value-adds like kombucha and red pepper chilli jam, whether for households or restaurants, some of which have begun delivery-based kitchens. Hes got orders from a few because, People are extremely conscious of what is going into their food now. While demand is growing, they are managing with existing capacity: Its difficult to build capacity at this time, says Achintya.He sees the lockdown as an opportunity to promote agri-businesses that grow crops free of chemical residue, and push for new hygiene-driven protocols and practices. Eventually, he would like to see farmers band together into a cooperative and set up a platform where the produce goes from farm to table. The focus needs to be on post-harvest handling. We produce fruit and vegetables as good as any in the world, as long as theyre on the tree or plant. Its what happens after: the storage, the cold chain maintenance. As for the future: I dont want to take any calls for the future. Even the chefs dont know when their restaurants will be up and running.Sunalini MathewFor a fair dealHFPA, BengaluruThe son of agriculturist Shekhappa, Jagadish Sunagad owns 15 acres of land at Baluti near Bijapur. His entrepreneurial skills have helped thousands of farmers in North Karnataka. I cannot get over the onion and watermelon losses this season, says Jagadish. I have an MBA, and being a farmer myself, I understand the farmers need to reach their produce to the right quarters. They need guidance in growing and getting the right subsidies.Jagadish, CEO of Basavana Bagewadi Horticulture Farmer Producer Company (HFPA) in Kolhar taluk of Bijapur district, has released nine videos on social media to help farmers. We have 1,000 farmers from 22 villages in the North Karnataka belt in HFPA. Karnataka has nearly 100 Farmer Producer Organisations with about 1,000 farmers, who swung into action to help crops reach consumers. I worked from Kolhar taluk to minimise losses for onion, watermelon, banana and maize. Jagadish arranged for nearly 100 tonnes of vegetables and fruits to reach cities every week.Transportation and labour were herculean tasks, but we saw to it that losses were restricted to about 50%. I roped in my family too; they accompanied the trucks. A farmer associate, Girish Telage, had six truckloads of watermelon worth 96,000. In Shivajinagar, he was offered 30,000. I intervened and re-routed the trucks to Yeshwantpur, Goraguntepalya, Peenya and Rajajinagar markets and got him a 20,000 profit.The best deal, according to Jagadish, was the direct FPO-to-FPO exchange programme, where vegetables and fruits were bartered depending on requirements from farmers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Onions (500 tonnes), watermelon (400 tonnes) and 200 tonnes of potato did not go waste, thanks to this arrangement, although pricing was heavily compromised.Ranjani GovindCultural redemptionSolitude Farm, AurovilleWhy are we eating cabbage, broccoli, and beetroot and not more sundakkai (turkey berry), vazhapoo (banana blossoms), and karunai kizhangu (yam)? This is among the many questions Aurovillian farmer Krishna McKenzie wants us to ask ourselves. According to him, the pandemic and resulting lockdown has been a catalyst in making us understand that a centralised system is not the most practical, or efficient answer our food needs. Deprived of vegetables when the existing food supply system faltered, he says that people are now waking up to local farming and local distribution.Krishna Mckenzie | Photo Credit: splThe 47-year-old Englishman, through his Solitude Farm in Auroville, has been at the forefront of what he calls a cultural redemption by reminding people of their traditional knowledge, particularly of food and the politics that surrounds it. He has been on his feet during lockdown, setting up kitchen gardens, as well as giving away keerai cuttings, saplings, and seeds to those looking for ways to start their own vegetable patch.More and more people are connecting with me now; just yesterday, someone came to take home murungai keerai (moringa) and vazhathandu (banana stem) cuttings, he says, adding that there has been an increase in the number of organic food baskets he sends out to Auroville and Puducherry. I have been helping people at their gardens, many of them are now thinking about growing their own food. They now have more time than they usually would. Krishna points out that people in his neighbourhood are coming together to share their produce.Krishna has been posting videos on social media on how to better employ urban spaces for vegetable gardening, as well as how to cook local vegetables. He says, This pandemic has been a wake-up call; it has shown us that the need for food is the common adhesive in the system; that food is one.Akila KannadasanSeeds of hopeSwadeshi Karshika Vipani, ThiruvananthapuramThe weekly agro bazaar in Thiruvananthapuram, Swadeshi Karshika Vipani, sells produce procured from organic farmers across the district. The maximum produce for this comes from Perumkadavila in Neyyattinkara, on the outskirts of the city. The closure of the market due to lockdown meant there was no avenue to sell the produce for these farmers.V Sreekumaran Nair, president of Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThat is when V Sreekumaran Nair, president of the Facebook group Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma, which is one of the driving forces behind this agri market, came up with a solution. He took orders via WhatsApp, collected produce from 14 farmers in the area and home-delivered the vegetables and fruits to regular customers in two autorickshaws.Produce from Sreekumaran Nairs farm kept for sale | Photo Credit: Special arrangementFour of us coordinated the supply. We have nearly 100 regular customers and could deliver the produce to about 40 of them. We did that until lockdown restrictions were made strict. After that, we started selling produce through an eco-shop with the support of the regional agricultural office and Panchayat officials. Now the produce gets sold at our farms itself, says Sreekumaran, who cultivates on over 2.5 acres. In addition, he has given away seeds and saplings for free.I have distributed them to 214 households and 80% of them are taking up farming for the first time. Since many of them are taking baby steps, I have distributed seeds of tomato, ladys finger, long beans, amaranthus, and brinjal that can be easily grown. Many came all the way from the city on two-wheelers to collect the seeds. There has been a renewed interest in farming and now many people seek help to set up kitchen/terrace gardens, he says. When I give away the seeds, I tell them that each has a life growing inside it and they have a responsibility to take care of it, he adds.Athira M"
11,11,2020-05-27,Haryana farmers in dismay over deep plunge in onion prices,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-in-dismay-over-deep-plunge-in-onion-prices/story-ymbxiaoGVobiq5jT5Mp8nI.html,"chandigarhUpdated: May 28, 2020 01:25 ISTOnion farmers across the state are in dismay as wholesale prices have crashed drastically and they are unable to cover the input cost amid the lack of buyers.Onion had dominated the headlines in October last year due to its skyrocketing prices, as it was sold for 100 per kg. But now, farmers are being forced to sell it for 7- 9 per kg in the absence of buyers. This has made them question the system of marketing vegetables in the country.The traders and farmers blame the Covid-19 lockdown for the fall in rates. The farmers revealed that big transporters and buyers were not showing interest in onion due to which they were unable to sell their entire produce in the local markets.In the absence of big traders due to the lockdown, we have been selling the crop to local merchants and street vendors. This is the reason why the prices have crashed to around 8 per kg from 14 per kg last year, said Raj Kumar, a trader from Pipli onion market in Kurukshetra.As per the traders, the Pipli mandi is the biggest onion market in the northern districts of Haryana and most farmers, even from Punjab, come here to sell their produce in hope of better prices. As there is no mechanism to store the produce, the farmers have no choice but to sell it even if at lower prices, said another trader Praveen Kumar, adding that there is no possibility of rise in the prices as the harvesting is in its last leg and most of the produce has already been purchased.However, the fall in prices has appalled the farmers.I sowed onion on two acres of land and yielded nearly 110 quintals per acre, hoping for handsome returns. But it was unable to fetch me even the input cost which is around 50,000 per acre, rued farmer Raj Kumar from Fatehgarh village of Yamunanagar district.Farmers also claimed that they had to purchase nurseries at higher prices this year.This year, the production cost has doubled as the farmers had to purchase onion nurseries at higher prices. Also, there has been also a dip of about 10-20 quintals in per acre yield due to untimely rainfall. Farmers have not been able to earn much so far this year, said Vijay Kumar, a farmer from of Kurukshetras Kaserla village.As per state horticulture department officials, due to the increase in the onion prices last year, the onion acreage has increased to over 36,000 hectares from 32,000 hectares and its production to around 8.77 lakh MT against the 7.80 lakh MT from last year."
12,12,2020-04-09,Social distancing takes a back seat at markets,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/social-distancing-takes-a-back-seat-at-markets/article31302590.ece,"A few days ago, the authorities shifted Raithara Santhe, the farmers market near Yelahanka, to a vacant plot opposite the University of Agricultural Science, Bengaluru. The aim was to ensure that the market had more space to operate and facilitate social distancing, one of the practices that helps curb the spread of COVID-19.At the new location, barricades were erected, police personnel were deployed at entry points, and announcements urging people not to crowd were made regularly. But, these measures have had no impact on most consumers, who, after failing to maintain any distance from fellow shoppers return to their homes to self-isolate.Every day, hundreds of people come here in their private vehicles to buy vegetables and fruits. We insist that they maintain distance while making purchases. Only some people listen, said a police constable on duty.The government officials were also seen appealing to people with little success. Please do not come here to purchase vegetables every day. Buy enough for a week, said one government official. For many residents, the visit to the market is a family outing. Three to four members from one family come in a car. People need to understand that this is not a picnic spot. We are going through a difficult time, the official added.Priya U., resident of Sahakarnagar, said: In this market, we can purchase vegetables at comparatively cheaper rates as we get it directly from farmers. But the absence of social distance is cause for concern. The authorities are doing their best and people should cooperate.Rain adds to woesOther markets, including wholesale ones, are facing similar problems. Onion and potato traders from Yeshwantpur APMC yard were shifted to Dasanapura APMC due to lack of space. However, traders at Dasanapura say that though the ground is vast, there are no measures taken to ensure social distancing. This defeats the purpose of shifting the market, a trader said.Traders estimate that there are 400 poople operating from Dasanapura. Hundreds of lorries and trucks of farmers and traders come here, said a trader. A trader at Singena Agrahara, where the Kalasipalyam wholesale market has been shifted, said: The whole place is filled with slush due to the recent rain.Rajendra Kumar Kataria, secretary to government, Agriculture, Horticulture and Sericulture, underscored the need for people to cooperate and defended the governments decision to shift the markets. Earlier, Raithara Santhe was operating in an area that is less than two acres of land. Maintaining social distancing was next to impossible there. After shifting to the the new place, the distancing is improving, he told The Hindu.He added that the State government was taking various measures to decongest the markets.In Bengaluru, 480 HOPCOMS stores had increased procurement from farmers. HOPCOMS mobile units have started selling vegetables and fruit in residential apartments and other designated clusters.We are also encouraging food processing units and agencies doing large procurements both in the State and outside to make direct purchases from farmers. This would reduce crowding at markets to a great extent, he said."

Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week."
