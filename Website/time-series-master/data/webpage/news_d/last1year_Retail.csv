(File photo)NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Are onions still wreaking havoc on your monthly budget? For once, supply issues are not to blame, with around 50 trucks of onions coming in from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Azadpur Mandi every day, each bringing in around 20 tonnes of the essential commodity.The reason why they continue to cost you a bomb then is the high retail and wholesale price differential in Delhi. While the wholesale price currently ranges between Rs 15/kg and Rs 25/kg, retailers are selling onions for anywhere between Rs 40/kg and Rs 60/kg. Usually, sellers keep a margin of Rs 15/kg to account for transportation, storage and other costs. A 100% margin, which even some traders find hard to explain, is biting consumers hard.In Nashik, which is Delhis biggest supplier, the average wholesale price has steadily dropped over the last few weeks. To put things in perspective, it was Rs 1,600/quintal on Friday, a drop of 40% from Rs 2,600/quintal on January 31. The average wholesale price had touched an all-time high of Rs 8,625/quintal on December 16 last year at Lasalgaon APMC, the countrys largest wholesale onion market. Since then, the prices has dropped almost 81%.In the past fortnight, the drop is nearly 64%  from Rs 4,100/quintal on January 20.This decline, however, is yet to reflect in the retail markets of Delhi. In terms of kilograms, when the wholesale price ranged between Rs 60 and Rs 100 from mid-December to mid-January, individual consumers were buying it for anywhere between Rs 80/kg and Rs 120/kg. On Friday, at the roadside stalls near Mata Sundri College in New Delhi, onions were being sold at Rs 50/kg. Similarly, in east Delhis Samaspur, the retail price was between Rs 55/kg and Rs 60/kg. Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller in Samaspur F Block, said the prices had come down by Rs 30-40/kg in a month. Its gradually going down, he claimed.In south Delhis Vasant Kunj, too, the current retail price hovered around Rs 50/kg.Rajan Pal, a seller at Bhogal vegetable market, said at Rs 55, the commodity was far cheaper than it was a couple of months ago when a kilogram cost above Rs 100. . We get onions from Afghanistan and other countries too, but people prefer the Indian version, he said.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, found the high wholesale-retail price differential surprising. There is no shortage of supply in the wholesale market. But the retail prices are much higher than usual, he said, adding that the retail prices were decided by the retailers. The economics of demand and supply determines the prices in the retail markets and there is no mechanism to control them. Factors like location and quality of the product play their part too: in upscale colonies, the retail prices are typically higher.Pintu Mandal, a seller at a market in Govindpuri, said onions were going as high as Rs 60/kg as the wholesale price was still steep. He attributed this to many wholesalers hoarding stocks with an eye on a dip in supply later.According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, there has been a rise in production in all onion-growing pockets of the country in the last one month, but the demand has remained in the same territory as earlier. This has led to a drop in the average wholesale price. Production is good in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu too. This has led to a drop in demand for Maharashtras onions. As a result, the average wholesale onion price has dropped, Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC, said. She said a continuous fluctuations in the wholesale price were also responsible for the selling price not stabilising. The Centre had yet to lift the stock limit on wholesale and onion traders, which had been cut from 50 tonnes to 25 tonnes for wholesalers and from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes for retailers, Jagtap said.The government needs to lift the restrictions on onion traders  both wholesalers and retailers, she added.A source in the Union ministry of agriculture, however, denied that there was any control over retail prices. Some retailers have already purchased onions from the wholesale market and are releasing these gradually. This is the reason for the wide gap. The retail prices will drop gradually, he said."

The price had spiked because of excess rain, which ruined the crop in several parts of the country.With supply stabilising, especially from Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, and exports banned, the rate is now easing, officials said.Consumers may be smiling but farmers are worried as they are not able to make more than Rs 17/kg as against the expected Rs 40.""We get onions from Nasik and Sholapur in Maharashtra. Nasik onions used to be exported but since that is currently banned, they are landing in Bengaluru, leaving the market here with a surplus,"" said K Lokesh, president, Karnataka State Onion Merchants Association.A farmer from Sholapur wh o was part of a onion growers' delegation which met traders in Bengaluru, said, ""The cost of everything has gone up.

Retail prices ranged between Rs 25-35 a kilo in the city on Thursday.Arrival of fresh stock is cited as reason for the slump in price. While consumers are happy, traders complain they were staring at losses as they had invested a lot earlier to procure from other States and even abroad.Wholesale traders have requested the Union government to lift the ban on export which is in place since last year.Due to inclement weather, onion cultivation dropped drastically in the State. This resulted in demand skyrocketing and sent prices on an upward spiral.Despite all efforts by the government, the price shot up to as much as Rs 160 a kilo.Grappling with supply chain, the Union government-imposed ban on exports in September 2019 till prices returned to normal. According to onion traders, while the daily requirement for onions is 600 tonnes,less than 50 per cent of it used to arrive in the market. To meet demand, onions were imported from Turkey and Egypt.A Thangaraj, secretary, Tiruchy Onion Wholesalers Association, said, Prices stood above Rs 100 per kg for almost six months, as a result of which sales was affected. With the arrival of harvest season, there is now steady supply, which led to the price drop. Since there is a export ban, cultivated onions from across the state are arriving in markets. Supply now exceeds demand. To handle the situation, the Union government must lift the ban on onion exports."
4,4,2020-03-04,Onion prices expected to rise in Gujarat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/onion-prices-expected-to-rise-as-union-govt-lifts-export-ban/articleshow/74466072.cms,"Picture used for representational purpose onlyRAJKOT: Onion prices are likely to upset budgets of families again.After embargo on exports imposed last year in wake of skyrocketing prices, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has allowed the free export of all varieties of onion from India beginning March 15. The notification issued by the DGFT on March 2 comes following representations from various marketing yards and farmer bodies including Mahuva marketing yard to the union minister of agriculture last month.Traders believe that the onion prices in local markets are likely to increase as a result of export and the crop arrival this year has already been delayed by two months due to prolonged inclement weather last year.In Bhavnagar and Mahuva yard, onion selling at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per 20 kg shot up Rs 470 two days before the news came in that government was likely to allow the export.Narendra Gohil, an onion trader in Bhavnagar yard said, When exports start, we are expect rise in price. At present, onions from Nashik market are pouring in domestic market. One exports begin, the demand for the Mahuva quality onion will increase in domestic market.The government of India had banned onion export on September 29 last year after the prices crossed Rs 150 per kg in retail market. Amreli and Bhavnagar are the two biggest onion producing districts in Gujarat.The normal season for the onion production is January and February, but this year the harvest has been delayed due to prolonged monsoon.According to agriculture department data, the onion sowing area increased to 39,000 hecatre in Gujarat in current financial year from 25,000 ha last year. However the yield is likely to decrease by 30% this year. The onion flood yards during the peak season, but this year we dont expect much yield because of some disease also, Gohil added.Currently, 15,000 bags (each containing 50kg) are coming for auction in Bhavnagar and Mahuva yards. Every year during peak season, 1.50 lakh bags are brought for auction. This year, traders expect around 60,000 to 75,000 bags daily.Vitthal Koradia, an onion exporter said, Generally, the onion crop comes in winter, but this year when the peak season arrives in April, the temperature will be high, which will damage the crop.Ghanshyam Patel, secretary, Mahuva marketing yard said, On February 5, we had represented to the union agriculture minister to allow export."

Order NowPUNE: Onion was auctioned in the range of Rs8-17 per kg at Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday  the first instance of its wholesale price dipping below the double-figure since the beginning of the ongoing season in January.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials attributed the slump in the onions wholesale price to dip in demand for the produce. Also, they pointed out that the commission agents, who facilitate auction of the farm produce, opened their shops after a break of two weeks. As such, the intake of fresh onion was high in the market.A total of 11,534 quintals of onion arrived in Gultekdi yard on Wednesday. This was more than expected and hence, the prices fell sharply in the open auction, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of vegetables, fruits, onion and potato division of the market yard.He said, Usually, hoteliers and other eateries in the city buy a bulk of onions, but these establishments are closed because of the lockdown. So, there wasnt much demand for onion in the open auction, which drove the price down to the seasons lowest so far. The onions sold at Rs8 per kg was of low standard. But till date, even this type of onion was being sold above Rs12 per kg.The APMC officials claimed that there was adequate supply of kitchen staple, but retail vendors were selling the produce at high price. Outside market yard, vendors are selling onion for anything between Rs35 and Rs40 per kg. People need not worry about the intake or supply at least for next four weeks, Kalamkar said.The wholesale price of potato also took a dip from Rs22-25 per kg two days back to Rs20-22 per kg on Wednesday with 15,281 quintals of potato arriving in the market. The arrival was a surplus, the APMC officials stated.Maximum potato is purchased by vada pav or pav bhaji vendors, which are closed these days. We expect further fall in prices in the coming days, Kalamkar added.The five sub-markets across the city, too, received surplus onion and potato supplies.Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of AFMC, appealed to farmers and commission agents not to bring produce in a large number as only 400 vehicles of vegetables are permitted nowadays every day.Maintaining social distance and avoiding mass gathering is necessary in the current situation. If we get more than 400 vehicles, the market would be crowded and following or implementing the government guidelines would be impossible, Deshmukh said."
6,6,2020-04-02,Tips on storing food during coronavirus pandemic,https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/food/2020/apr/02/tips-on-storing-food-during-coronavirus-pandemic-2124503.html,"Kakoli Mukherjee ByExpress News ServiceThese uncertain times following COVID-19 outbreak have laid bare things which were being taken for granted for long.For example, our Rythu bazaars and our grocery home delivery services. Though the government has categorised them under essential supplies, the ground reality is different with leading delivery services suspending their operations.While hoarding is not advised, we can choose to stock up a pantry with food grains and items that have long shelf lives. Here, chef Shri Bala, heritage cusine expert gives some tips on how to store herbs and grains in a way so that they last a long time.Grains and lentils:Dry them for four hours in the sun. Put 2-3 sun-dried neem leaves at the bottom of an airtight container. Then put in the grains and again put 2-3 sun-dried neem leaves on top. This ensures that the grains stay free from insects for a long time.CorianderWash them thoroughly and cut the roots. Put them on a kitchen towel so that all moisture is absorbed. Then wrap them in paper napkins and store in a plastic container. Please do not separate the leaves from the stalks.Mint leavesMint leaves cannot be washed before storing as they tend to turn black. The leaves can be washed as and when being used for cooking. After you buy the leaves, cut their roots and put them on a kitchen towel to absorb any moisture. In the next step, wrap them in paper napkins and store in a plastic container.Curry leavesSeparate the sprigs from the bark stem. Wash them, dry them on a kitchen towel, wrap in paper napkins and store in plastic containers. Be careful not to separate the leaves from the sprigs.CauliflowerCut the leaves and large stem, and break it into florets. These florets can be stored in an airtight bag in the refrigerator. If you dont have zipped bags, put them in a plastic bag and seal it using a candle. Storing cauliflowers in this way makes sure that they dont fall prey to worms.Leafy vegetablesIn case of spinach, amaranth and other leafy vegetables, separate the leaves from the stalks, wash them, dry them, and then store in airtight bags.Onions and potatoesThese survive a long time without refrigeration, but make sure that they are kept separately and have enough breathing space. If they are kept too close to each other, dampness might grow which will ultimately cut short their shelf life.Cooked foodTalking about cooked food, chef Sakala Shankara of ITC Kakatiya says that adding any citric agent like lemon, tamarind or vinegar can increase the shelf life of food. Dishes like pulihora can stay outside for a longer time without refrigeration. In villages, they dry tomatoes and mangoes in the sun. This ensures that they have supply for a long time.Pantry Suggestions"

For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi . Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.""Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,"" Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearly Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: ""I don't have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.""Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, ""Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.""Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat 's headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works."

There are only so many trips to the fridge you can take before you give in to the inevitable monotony of your food during this quarantine period. But dont fret yet cause Monika Manchandas got your back.The popular Bengaluru-based food blogger and home baker took to her social media handles on Twitter and Instagram, last week, asking her followers to tell her whats in their pantry after requests for help with recipes flooded her inbox. I saw a lot of friends struggling with cooking and had a few panicky messages and calls, asking how to use certain ingredients that they had in their fridge. Since its such a common worry, I thought Id take this session to my social media audience as well, explains Monika. The simple question solicited an overwhelming response, she adds.Requests ranged everywhere from  what do I make with leftover pumpkin, to its my birthday in two days, how do I bake a cake without an oven? As promised, a recipe suggestion followed every query. Only have Brussel sprouts and beetroot? Make grilled Brussels sprouts with garlic, olive oil and pepper. Have a random jar of poppy seeds? Why not mix them with some oats and honey to make some snack bars? I want to do my part in helping people during this lockdown.You have these ingredients but you dont know what to do with them  thats something I can help with, she adds. Most often, the requests are for simple and comforting bowls of food that are tinted with nostalgia, she notes. As for herself, Monika admits shes staying busy and bustling during her time at home. For a lot of us, food has always been a source of comfort. Something we turn to when were down or on the other hand, something we celebrate with.Theyre intimately connected to emotions, and now that the general morale is down, its inevitable that were turning to it for comfort, says the food writer. Its a real stress buster for me, so Im chopping away in the kitchen, she adds on a lighter note. As Monika chops away, the rest of us can don our chef whites and whip up one of her recipes  a bowl of curry noodles, her go-to for a warm and straightforward meal.For recipes, visitsinamontales.com.

Ideally, they say, to cook mushrooms the best way, you should not wash them. But somehow, I am not comfortable doing that. So clean and completely dry before using. Also, cut onions and baby corninto thick slices.Heat oil in a pan and add garlic to the same. Let it brown, and then add the onions. Once the onions are soft (we dont want to cook them too much or brown them), add baby corn and cook on high flame till it starts browning.Its now time to add mushrooms. Ideally, mushrooms should be cooked separately in a wide pot with sufficient distance between them to breathe, but its okay to stir them along with the onions and baby corn. Cook till the mushrooms are done.Add in the red curry paste. If you dont have red curry paste, dont worry. Any chilli paste or hot sauce works too. You might have to adjust the quantity depending on just how spicyit is. Add in the coconut milk too and bring everything to a boil. If you like your curry noodles really saucy, increase the coconut milk and curry paste here. Actually, you can use any vegetables you have handy. Like always, I think recipes should be like canvases and we all should paintour mind in them"

Similarly, potato was auctioned for Rs15-23 per kg as against Rs12-22 per kg last time.Some traders from Kerala and Tamil Nadu supplied the produce to neighbouring states. Also, police are not restricting goods transport. Thus, traders from other cities, too, are coming to the market. As a result, there was better demand for onion today, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of the onion and potato division of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard, adding that a bulk of the produce came from Baramati, Daund and Shirur tehsils.In the fruit market, the supply of mango increased significantly. So, its price came down to the range of Rs1,000-3,000 per box of four dozen of mangoes. Last time, mango was auctioned for Rs3,500-7,000 per box. The market received maximum mangoes from Ratnagiri and some from Karnataka on Monday. Since mango growers are permitted to carry their produce to the market, we expect the similar arrival in the coming days, said Babasaheb Bibave, the head of the fruit division of the market.The price of apple and grapes increased marginally. A kg apple was sold for Rs90-160 as against the previous bazaar rate of Rs80-140 per kg. Grapes were sold in the range of Rs50-70 per kg. However, rates of summer fruits like orange, watermelon and musk melon have remained stable, Bibave added.The price of edible oil dropped on Monday after the wholesale grocery market received its surplus intake of edible oil on Monday.Its price came down to the range of Rs1,250-1,500 per can of 15 litres. In the last bazaar, the prices were in the range of Rs1,100-Rs2,400 per can. We received 27 vehicles of oil from different places on Monday and so there was immediate impact on the rates. This increased intake will ensure stable prices of the oil in the coming days in the city, said Nitin Raskar, the head of the grocery division."

Fruit trade was the most badly hit, with the volume of arriving apples from the northern States crashing more than 83% in comparison to the previous year. Onion and potato arrivals were over 40% lower than the previous year. Tomatoes were about a third of the volume which arrived in the previous year.On Wednesday, responding to concerns about crowding and a failure to practice social distancing at the mandi, the APMC reportedly told traders that they would only be allowed to bring in one truck each per day. The APMC also decided to allow trade in alternate auction sheds only. These moves are meant to prevent the mandi from becoming another hotspot of COVID-19 infections, but are also likely to further reduce the volumes of fruits and vegetables arriving at the mandi.(With inputs from The Hindu Data team)"

While traders and transporters are facing a lot of challenges during the lockdown such as shortage of supply from other districts, drop of market price, transportation constraints, etc, this has added no less to their burdens. The revised rates of toll charges by NHAI came into effect on Monday.We are already facing shortage of lorry drivers due to coronavirus scare. Transportation cost has increased at least by Rs 3,000 - Rs 4,000 per trip. The additional charges will only increase the prices of commodities, said G Subbu, President of the Tiruchy Lorry Owners Association.The cost of vegetables has significantly increased. One kg of potato which was sold for `50 per kg now cost Rs 70-80 per kg, according to traders. The prices have drastically increased in the last couple of days. With the import varied and markets running in a non-regular manner, we have no other option but to hike the vegetables price, said Murugan, a trader at the Gandhi market.Onion price slumpsOn the contrary, onion prices dropped due to lack of export and extreme weather conditions. One kg was sold at Rs 10- Rs 15 as against Rs 40 per kg a week ago.More than 500 tonnes of onions are stuck in the warehouses. Hence, we are dumping at least 30 tonnes of onion every day as they got ruined, said Thangaraj, Secretary of Onion Whole sellers Associations. The wholesalers in the district requested the district administration to permit them to unload onions as and when they arrived and not particularly at nights as they claimed that the weather caused more damage to vegetables packed inside tarpaulin sheets."

It also decided to use idle state bus fleet to ferry essentials and perishables, and also sort out serious drinking water problems.The four-hour emergency meeting of ministers and bureaucrats discussed several critical issues related to the Covid outbreak. The bureaucracy was told to accelerate the administration, noting that development processes has slowed down since the lockdown kicked in in the last week of March. The meeting was held in response to complaints that farmers were losing vegetables and fruits as they did not have storage facilities. Yediyurappa suggested that cold storage was the only solution and that farmers be encouraged to utilise the states facilities. Farmers will also be encouraged to sell their produce to markets in other states and export it.The lockdown has particularly affected mango farmers, for whom this is the season to export to markets abroad and also to other states. It was decided that wherever there was shortage of drinking water, the government would step in to supply water on an emergency basis, and ensure that it is good quality potable water due to the fear of COVID infection.The government also decided to release excess water stored in dams to farmers, to be used for irrigation and drinking purpose. After floods caused serious damage last year, the authorities have been instructed to obtain water availability information from dams. The meeting also decided to expedite setting up of a village-level task force to deal with COVID-related issues at the local level. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda assured the chief minister that farmers would receive fertilisers at lower prices, due to the factors like a dip in international demand.Various organisations that have been granted land but have failed to use it, have been instructed to return the land to the government, especially where lease conditions have been violated. The meeting also decided to encourage domestic tourism to overcome the effects of the sharp drop in the number of international tourists due to the COVID outbreak. Online lessons will be encouraged, and teachers will be instructed to hold classes via internet and television.Banana farmers a worried lotShivamogga: Banana farmers are finding it difficult to sell their produce. They have been selling Yelakki baale for Rs 30 per kg and Pachcha baale for Rs 20 per kg, which was Rs 50-60 per kg and Rs 40 per kg respectively before the lockdown. We used to purchase from growers and sell it in Mangaluru and Udupi markets. Now, both these markets are closed, said Siddalingeshwar of Basaveshwara Mandi.Onion seed prices leave farmers in tearsWith the lockdown triggering shortage of supply of onion seeds, the prices in Mysuru region have soared. Farmers attribute it to restrictions on vehicles coming from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other states to the region. Small onion seeds, that were sold for Rs 35-40 a kilo last year, is now priced at Rs 85 per kg. Now, a farmer has to cough up Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh to grow onion on one acre.PAY HIKE FOR CONTRACT DOCTORSDoctors working on contract with the state government, who are on the frontline battling Covid-19, will receive higher remuneration. The meeting did not take up the issue of hike in the salaries off nurses,ANMs and other medical teams."

The tally breached the 31,000-mark on Wednesday.Services, movement and operations associated with essential services and items were allowed right from the start. The government ensured that regular supplies of food items and other essentials remain uninterrupted across the country during the lockdown.A look at the monthly summary released by the Department of Consumer Affairs suggests that amid the lockdown, the prices of oil, pulses have gone up while vegetables cost more or less the same with a mild dip in prices.Data from the ministry show that prices of rice, most varieties of pulses and oils have gone up across the nation.At the beginning of the lockdown (March 24), pulses costed roughly around at Rs 72 per kilogram but the figures for April 28 show that the price went up to Rs 86, HTs Hindi language publication Live Hindustan reported citing government data. Statistics from the Price Monitoring Division of the ministry show that the price of arhar dal has increased to Rs 13 in Delhi and Rs 30 rupees per kilogram in Warangal, Telangana.Similarly, in the case of mustard oil, the price has increased by Rs 20 per kg in Gurugram, Haryana while in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh it has reached Rs 170 per kg. Prices of vegetable oil have also gone up and so have the price for sugar which has increased by more than two rupees in Delhi.Prices of vegetables, on the other hand, have fallen. Ministry data from March 24 to April 28 of the Price Monitoring Division show that the price of potato has decreased across the country except for Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Onion prices have also come down roughly by around Rs 20 per kg.Meanwhile, the temporary closure of Delhi-Haryana border is likely to affect the supply of fruits and vegetables in the national capital, news agency PTI reported.The prices of vegetables like ladys finger, cucumber and bottle gourd might increase in the national capital as their supply from Sonipat to Azadpur Mandi is likely to get affected by up to 30% in the wake of the sealing of the Delhi-Haryana border.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said that there is some news coming from Sonipat that supply of vegetables from the neighbouring state was not being allowed in Delhi.With this, the supply of cucumber, ladys finger, bottle gourd and other vegetables from Sonipat to Azadpur Mandi may be affected by up to 30 per cent, Khan said."

Wholesale traders and brokers have been asked to send essentials procured from farmers to Mumbai markets directly, bypassing the Vashi APMC to ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted due to the shutdown of the markets.The decision to shut all five markets was taken after the stakeholders like traders, brokers, transporters and workers expressed unwillingness to work fearing risk to their lives after a spike in number of positive cases reported from APMC market yard in the last few days. A meeting of top bureaucrats was held on Friday at the APMC market to decide the line of action. Various traders bodies also wrote to the APMC administration to shut the market.The decision to shut the market came as a preventive measure as thousands flock the wholesale market daily. Earlier, the Navi Mumbai mayor Jayawant Sutar, NMMC administrator Annasaheb Misal, local MLA Ganesh Naik had demanded closure of APMC immediately in view of rising number of corona cases as the wholesale market has become the corona hotspot in the city.According to APMC sources, a review will be conducted on May 15 to check that whether the situation is conducive to restart the market. APMC deputy secretary Krishnakant Pawar said, During the shutdown we will conduct sanitisation and disinfection of the whole market premises, before the review date. Presently, most of the traders are sending essentials directly to Mumbai and the remaining should follow suit. APMC director Sanjay Pansare said, Screening of all the stakeholders is the need of the hour."

Unable to put up with the long waiting time to enter the market, many small retailers had stopped going Thirumazhisai for purchase. This is forcing wholesale traders to sell the produce at throwaway prices. On an average, the market gets about 4,000 tonnes of vegetables daily. About 500 tonnes goes waste as there is no space to store them.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of Koyambedu Market Wholesale Merchants Association, said this had affected farmers who were bringing produce to the market. For instance, vegetables such as brinjal and ladies finger were sold 5 a kg as there were no takers at the end of stipulated business hours. Even carrots were sold 7 a kg.Farmers suffered a loss because such vegetables must be sold for a minimum of 10 a kg for them to cover labour charges and transportation. These benefits never reach the customers in the city as many retailers dont reduce the price, he said.Onions and potatoes can be stocked better than green vegetables. Moreover, only a section of shops get more business and those at the rear tend to dump vegetables for want of takers. The authorities concerned must help distribute the vehicles entering the market to all shops to prevent wastage, the traders said. They suggested that the government could adopt similar measures with stringent norms and reopen Koyambedu market soon."

His Hyderabad-based enterprise, Kiaro Foods, which started as a dairy production and delivery brand, remodelled itself into a farm-to-home service, within a week of the lockdown. The app-based brand has been able to supply seasonal vegetables and fruits, including much-coveted mangoes during the lockdown.Kiaro Farms setups for bringing fresh produce to different parts of Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath shares, Letting good produce that wasnt going out of Telangana rot seemed like not only a waste but also meant we werent utilising our existing logistics the right way. After much thought we redesigned our app and introduced same-day harvested vegetables. The re-branding exercise was driven by the need to help farmers, so that their hard work and produce would not go waste. In the process, ledgers and accounts have gone for a toss, as they focussed on sourcing and logistics as the lockdown came as a bolt from the blue.A young woman with her selection of fresh produce and baked goods from Kiaro Foods, Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath says, At first, we sourced and sold produce without grading; we are not very proud about that. However, we learnt from our mistakes and reworked the system and started grading the vegetables and fruits. Then we sourced eggs from an exporter and started selling them through the app. Soon we realised there was a huge demand for bread, wheat, fruits. We literally rebuilt ourselves on the basis of demand. Our motive was to make sure people get what they need. The breads we supply are from an upscale confectionery thats known for its desserts; the wheat is also from an exporter who had a big amount of fresh wheat that couldnt be exported due to lockdown.Prabalika M BorahHobby turns into needThe Prodigal Farms, NoidaPuneet Tyagi and Neha Bhatia started farming as a hobby four years ago, and soon turned it into a business, first with farm-to-fork weekend experiences and zero-waste workshops, and now with home delivery of their produce that is free of inorganic additives. We have six farmers working with us, four of whom are women. Their husbands lost their jobs, and so came to the farm; we were able to employ them to deliver the produce, says Puneet. He says the vegetables are harvested and packed into boxes by the farmers and they would be loaded and delivered by another set of people, ensuring minimal handling.Initially, they needed to realign deliveries only to Noida, but have now worked out a system of delivering across Delhi-NCR (theprodigalfarms.com/farmstore). Because orders had drastically reduced, and they had a lot of produce, they began making home processed foods like pickle, which people can order. Puneet says the lockdown has helped bring the farmers in the neighbourhood together and many have shown an interest in halting the use of artificial pesticide and fertilizer.Sunalini MathewFarm platformKrishi Cress, Chattarpur and FaridabadAchintya Anand, a chef and first-generation farmer, began five years ago, by supplying produce to restaurants and hotels. The lockdown saw demand from the hospitality sector dip to almost nothing.Within a week or so of operation, the website, orders.krishicress.com, which had been ready, went up for home-delivery orders. We had been trying it out for a year, but we had a small presence, says Achintya. Now, orders have doubled, but the cost of logistics poses a challenge. Also, there are two farms, in Chattarpur and Faridabad, so coordinating transportation has not been easy. Another challenge has been maintaining hygiene protocols and implementing changes overnight.We are very lucky because a lot of our staff stay at the farm, so theres minimal contact from the outside; the rest all live close by. Also, as we are located in a remote area, we had started a pick-up and drop facility before the first lockdown, he says.What remains popular are his salad and microgreens, as well as the value-adds like kombucha and red pepper chilli jam, whether for households or restaurants, some of which have begun delivery-based kitchens. Hes got orders from a few because, People are extremely conscious of what is going into their food now. While demand is growing, they are managing with existing capacity: Its difficult to build capacity at this time, says Achintya.He sees the lockdown as an opportunity to promote agri-businesses that grow crops free of chemical residue, and push for new hygiene-driven protocols and practices. Eventually, he would like to see farmers band together into a cooperative and set up a platform where the produce goes from farm to table. The focus needs to be on post-harvest handling. We produce fruit and vegetables as good as any in the world, as long as theyre on the tree or plant. Its what happens after: the storage, the cold chain maintenance. As for the future: I dont want to take any calls for the future. Even the chefs dont know when their restaurants will be up and running.Sunalini MathewFor a fair dealHFPA, BengaluruThe son of agriculturist Shekhappa, Jagadish Sunagad owns 15 acres of land at Baluti near Bijapur. His entrepreneurial skills have helped thousands of farmers in North Karnataka. I cannot get over the onion and watermelon losses this season, says Jagadish. I have an MBA, and being a farmer myself, I understand the farmers need to reach their produce to the right quarters. They need guidance in growing and getting the right subsidies.Jagadish, CEO of Basavana Bagewadi Horticulture Farmer Producer Company (HFPA) in Kolhar taluk of Bijapur district, has released nine videos on social media to help farmers. We have 1,000 farmers from 22 villages in the North Karnataka belt in HFPA. Karnataka has nearly 100 Farmer Producer Organisations with about 1,000 farmers, who swung into action to help crops reach consumers. I worked from Kolhar taluk to minimise losses for onion, watermelon, banana and maize. Jagadish arranged for nearly 100 tonnes of vegetables and fruits to reach cities every week.Transportation and labour were herculean tasks, but we saw to it that losses were restricted to about 50%. I roped in my family too; they accompanied the trucks. A farmer associate, Girish Telage, had six truckloads of watermelon worth 96,000. In Shivajinagar, he was offered 30,000. I intervened and re-routed the trucks to Yeshwantpur, Goraguntepalya, Peenya and Rajajinagar markets and got him a 20,000 profit.The best deal, according to Jagadish, was the direct FPO-to-FPO exchange programme, where vegetables and fruits were bartered depending on requirements from farmers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Onions (500 tonnes), watermelon (400 tonnes) and 200 tonnes of potato did not go waste, thanks to this arrangement, although pricing was heavily compromised.Ranjani GovindCultural redemptionSolitude Farm, AurovilleWhy are we eating cabbage, broccoli, and beetroot and not more sundakkai (turkey berry), vazhapoo (banana blossoms), and karunai kizhangu (yam)? This is among the many questions Aurovillian farmer Krishna McKenzie wants us to ask ourselves. According to him, the pandemic and resulting lockdown has been a catalyst in making us understand that a centralised system is not the most practical, or efficient answer our food needs. Deprived of vegetables when the existing food supply system faltered, he says that people are now waking up to local farming and local distribution.Krishna Mckenzie | Photo Credit: splThe 47-year-old Englishman, through his Solitude Farm in Auroville, has been at the forefront of what he calls a cultural redemption by reminding people of their traditional knowledge, particularly of food and the politics that surrounds it. He has been on his feet during lockdown, setting up kitchen gardens, as well as giving away keerai cuttings, saplings, and seeds to those looking for ways to start their own vegetable patch.More and more people are connecting with me now; just yesterday, someone came to take home murungai keerai (moringa) and vazhathandu (banana stem) cuttings, he says, adding that there has been an increase in the number of organic food baskets he sends out to Auroville and Puducherry. I have been helping people at their gardens, many of them are now thinking about growing their own food. They now have more time than they usually would. Krishna points out that people in his neighbourhood are coming together to share their produce.Krishna has been posting videos on social media on how to better employ urban spaces for vegetable gardening, as well as how to cook local vegetables. He says, This pandemic has been a wake-up call; it has shown us that the need for food is the common adhesive in the system; that food is one.Akila KannadasanSeeds of hopeSwadeshi Karshika Vipani, ThiruvananthapuramThe weekly agro bazaar in Thiruvananthapuram, Swadeshi Karshika Vipani, sells produce procured from organic farmers across the district. The maximum produce for this comes from Perumkadavila in Neyyattinkara, on the outskirts of the city. The closure of the market due to lockdown meant there was no avenue to sell the produce for these farmers.V Sreekumaran Nair, president of Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThat is when V Sreekumaran Nair, president of the Facebook group Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma, which is one of the driving forces behind this agri market, came up with a solution. He took orders via WhatsApp, collected produce from 14 farmers in the area and home-delivered the vegetables and fruits to regular customers in two autorickshaws.Produce from Sreekumaran Nairs farm kept for sale | Photo Credit: Special arrangementFour of us coordinated the supply. We have nearly 100 regular customers and could deliver the produce to about 40 of them. We did that until lockdown restrictions were made strict. After that, we started selling produce through an eco-shop with the support of the regional agricultural office and Panchayat officials. Now the produce gets sold at our farms itself, says Sreekumaran, who cultivates on over 2.5 acres. In addition, he has given away seeds and saplings for free.I have distributed them to 214 households and 80% of them are taking up farming for the first time. Since many of them are taking baby steps, I have distributed seeds of tomato, ladys finger, long beans, amaranthus, and brinjal that can be easily grown. Many came all the way from the city on two-wheelers to collect the seeds. There has been a renewed interest in farming and now many people seek help to set up kitchen/terrace gardens, he says. When I give away the seeds, I tell them that each has a life growing inside it and they have a responsibility to take care of it, he adds.Athira M"
18,18,2020-05-24,Wholesale veggie prices crash during lockdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wholesale-veggie-prices-crash-during-lockdown/articleshow/75927840.cms,"In the two months since the country went into lockdown, vegetable prices have crashed in wholesale markets across states. The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others."

But now, farmers are being forced to sell it for 7- 9 per kg in the absence of buyers. This has made them question the system of marketing vegetables in the country.The traders and farmers blame the Covid-19 lockdown for the fall in rates. The farmers revealed that big transporters and buyers were not showing interest in onion due to which they were unable to sell their entire produce in the local markets.In the absence of big traders due to the lockdown, we have been selling the crop to local merchants and street vendors. This is the reason why the prices have crashed to around 8 per kg from 14 per kg last year, said Raj Kumar, a trader from Pipli onion market in Kurukshetra.As per the traders, the Pipli mandi is the biggest onion market in the northern districts of Haryana and most farmers, even from Punjab, come here to sell their produce in hope of better prices. As there is no mechanism to store the produce, the farmers have no choice but to sell it even if at lower prices, said another trader Praveen Kumar, adding that there is no possibility of rise in the prices as the harvesting is in its last leg and most of the produce has already been purchased.However, the fall in prices has appalled the farmers.I sowed onion on two acres of land and yielded nearly 110 quintals per acre, hoping for handsome returns. But it was unable to fetch me even the input cost which is around 50,000 per acre, rued farmer Raj Kumar from Fatehgarh village of Yamunanagar district.Farmers also claimed that they had to purchase nurseries at higher prices this year.This year, the production cost has doubled as the farmers had to purchase onion nurseries at higher prices. Also, there has been also a dip of about 10-20 quintals in per acre yield due to untimely rainfall. Farmers have not been able to earn much so far this year, said Vijay Kumar, a farmer from of Kurukshetras Kaserla village.As per state horticulture department officials, due to the increase in the onion prices last year, the onion acreage has increased to over 36,000 hectares from 32,000 hectares and its production to around 8.77 lakh MT against the 7.80 lakh MT from last year."

(Source: File Photo) It is always good to prepare fresh onion juice. (Source: File Photo)Onion juice, though not the subject of extensive research, has become quite popular as an anti-hair fall/hair regrowth agent. It has been used as a home remedy for years now for controlling hair fall. Science has proved that sulphur, the beauty mineral, is the chief element in onion juice, which helps boost the hair growth. Onion juice also provides micro-nutrients like vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6, and potassium, explained Dr Pallavi Sule, Mumbai-based dermatologist and aesthetic physician while explaining the benefits and quick uses of this easily available home remedy.Dr Sule explained, Onion juice may boost circulation as it also contains anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Applying onion juice to the hair and scalp could increase blood supply to hair follicles, which in turn improves hair growth. Onion juice is also found useful in delaying the premature greying of hair (though there are no studies to confirm this). This is attributed to production of the enzyme catalase in the hair follicles.Follow Indian Express Covid-19 tracker for latest updatesIngesting vs applyingAs we are specifically looking for hair regrowth, topical or local application can give the desired result, rather than ingestion. There are a lot of combinations available in the market for onion juice. These are creams, hair oils, shampoos and so on.

21,21,2020-02-11,Onion prices drop to Rs 25 a kg in Chennai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/onion-prices-drop-to-25-a-kilo-in-city/articleshow/74090487.cms,"This story is from February 12, 2020Representative imageCHENNAI: An additional dash of onions sprinkled over chats or uttappams is no longer a luxury. After months of soaring prices, touching almost Rs200 a kilogram, it is now selling at Rs 25 in most retail markets and online stores. And if you shop in Koyambedu, the prices could be up to Rs 5 less.Besides import, the new onion crop has brought down the prices drastically. The exhorbitant cost of the kitchen staple had affected food prices in eateries and even led to onion thefts. Since the onion yield now is good, the market is again getting supplies from Nasik, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We are back to normal. We have more supply than the demand. So, cost has come down, said R Sounderrajan, head of the Koyambedu Onion Trader Association.Cost of other veggies such as tomatoes, beans, carrots, capsicum and cauliflower are also low. While a kilogram of radish and bottle gourd is retailing at Rs10, tomatoes and okra cost Rs12 per kg, premium quality of cauliflower and a kilo of beans is sold at Rs20. They cost up to Rs5 lesser in Koyambedu, said Rajesh Kumar, who has a retail shop at Koyambedu market.Almost nearing the end of season, peas is being sold at Rs35 a kg, butter beans at Rs100 and double beans at Rs80. Spicy ingredients like green chillies and ginger are also easy on the pocket at Rs15 per kg.The only vegetable still causing a heartburn for households is the drumstick at Rs110 per kg. One stick costs Rs12 even in Koyambedu, said Sounderrajan. But in a few weeks it will come down to Rs10 for three to five sticks. Soon, we will have a good harvest within the state, he said."

(File Photo) A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with. (File Photo)The Pune Municipal Corporation has sought the expertise of police investigators in the use of technology for tracing the likely contacts of a person declared infected with the COVDI-19 disease.Rahul Jagtap, incharge of information technology wing at the PMC, said these days crime investigation relies heavily on technology, and police teams are very skilled at tracing the whereabouts and the likely contacts of a criminal.We are exploring whether those same skills of the police can be used in tracing the persons who might have come in contact with a person infected with Coronavirus. We have shared the mobile phone number of some of the infected people in the city with the cyber crime cell for assistance in tracing their contacts, he said.A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with, especially in the case of people who start showing symptoms only after a few days.It is noticed that many infected persons do not show symptoms initially and freely move around. They are tested and confirmed as positive cases, only after they show symptoms after a few days. In such cases, contact tracing gets very difficult. But we also have to ensure that no possible case of spread of the virus is left out, the officer said.Vegetable prices soar as markets closed till March 31On a day when markets in the city were shut except those dealing in essential commodities, prices of vegetables skyrocketed on Monday amid high demand and shrinking supply.Traders and vendors said people were panic shopping created by the fear of shutdown, following the spread of COVID-19.Onion, potato, green vegetables, coriander, green chillies were sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 more than the rates they were being sold until the weekend.The supply of vegetables has gone down while the demand is high, as people are purchasing in large quantities, said an official from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) that runs Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard.Taking advantage of the situation, local vendors too have hiked the vegetable prices. The rates of one kilogram of most vegetables in suburban area remained anywhere between Rs 50 and Rs 90 on Monday.A vendor at Chinchwad said, I will need to replenish my stocks twice a week, but this time, my stocks lasted only for a day.

23,23,2020-04-09,Cost of essentials spike amid lockdown in Odisha,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2020/apr/09/cost-of-essentials-spike-amid-lockdown-in-odisha-2127776.html,"By Express News ServiceJEYPORE: With the lockdown affecting transportation of commodities, price of grocery items and vegetables has skyrocketed in Koraput district. In fact, prices of daily requirements like wheat, pulses, potatoes, onions and edible oil are differing from one market to another.While all vegetables are selling beyond Rs 40 per kg, cost of edible oil in retail units is Rs100 per litre and that of pulses is Rs90 per kg. Onions are selling at Rs 33 per kg. All the commodities were selling at 15 per cent less than the existing rates prior to the lockdown. Considering that all vegetables except onions and potatoes are grown in Koraput, the price rise has come as a shocker to locals.When we buy from retail shops, the vendors give us at least 10 per cent discount but now they are giving any rebate because of poor supply of commodities from other states, said Rajiv Mishra, a resident of Jeypore town. He added that even green leafy vegetables are being sold at Rs15 to Rs20 per bundle.Sources in Jeypore Chamber of Commerce and Industries said the price rise is due to hike in transportation cost. There is adequate stock of essential commodities in the market but the price is high now as wholesalers have to pay more for transporting them from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal, reasoned secretary of the Jeypore Chamber of Commerce and Industries, V Pravakar. Similar is the case with vegetables which are being brought to urban areas from villages.District Civil Supply Officer TR Nayak, assured to regulate the prices and check hoarding."
24,24,2020-04-09,Social distancing takes a back seat at markets,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/social-distancing-takes-a-back-seat-at-markets/article31302590.ece,"A few days ago, the authorities shifted Raithara Santhe, the farmers market near Yelahanka, to a vacant plot opposite the University of Agricultural Science, Bengaluru. The aim was to ensure that the market had more space to operate and facilitate social distancing, one of the practices that helps curb the spread of COVID-19.At the new location, barricades were erected, police personnel were deployed at entry points, and announcements urging people not to crowd were made regularly. But, these measures have had no impact on most consumers, who, after failing to maintain any distance from fellow shoppers return to their homes to self-isolate.Every day, hundreds of people come here in their private vehicles to buy vegetables and fruits. We insist that they maintain distance while making purchases. Only some people listen, said a police constable on duty.The government officials were also seen appealing to people with little success. Please do not come here to purchase vegetables every day. Buy enough for a week, said one government official. For many residents, the visit to the market is a family outing. Three to four members from one family come in a car. People need to understand that this is not a picnic spot. We are going through a difficult time, the official added.Priya U., resident of Sahakarnagar, said: In this market, we can purchase vegetables at comparatively cheaper rates as we get it directly from farmers. But the absence of social distance is cause for concern. The authorities are doing their best and people should cooperate.Rain adds to woesOther markets, including wholesale ones, are facing similar problems. Onion and potato traders from Yeshwantpur APMC yard were shifted to Dasanapura APMC due to lack of space. However, traders at Dasanapura say that though the ground is vast, there are no measures taken to ensure social distancing. This defeats the purpose of shifting the market, a trader said.Traders estimate that there are 400 poople operating from Dasanapura. Hundreds of lorries and trucks of farmers and traders come here, said a trader. A trader at Singena Agrahara, where the Kalasipalyam wholesale market has been shifted, said: The whole place is filled with slush due to the recent rain.Rajendra Kumar Kataria, secretary to government, Agriculture, Horticulture and Sericulture, underscored the need for people to cooperate and defended the governments decision to shift the markets. Earlier, Raithara Santhe was operating in an area that is less than two acres of land. Maintaining social distancing was next to impossible there. After shifting to the the new place, the distancing is improving, he told The Hindu.He added that the State government was taking various measures to decongest the markets.In Bengaluru, 480 HOPCOMS stores had increased procurement from farmers. HOPCOMS mobile units have started selling vegetables and fruit in residential apartments and other designated clusters.We are also encouraging food processing units and agencies doing large procurements both in the State and outside to make direct purchases from farmers. This would reduce crowding at markets to a great extent, he said."

The target this time is to buy 1 lakh tonnes of key kitchen staple from the major producing states, it said.""This initiative will have dual benefit of stabilising the domestic prices of onion in the COVID-19 time as well and create an all-time high buffer stocking of 1 lakh tonne which may be utilised for the lean months,"" National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) said in a statement.It has already purchased 25,000 tonnes at the prevailing rates. Onion is being purchased from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat from FPOs, cooperatives as well as direct purchase centres.Currently, the onion prices for fair average quality are ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,400 per quintal, depending on the location. The retail prices in major cities at present are ruling in the range of Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nafed said regular virtual review meetings are being held with FPOs, member cooperative societies and branches to monitor the progress of procurement, as ground challenges remain due to the deadly disease.At some places, pre-monsoon showers are affecting the pace of procurement.This season, the services of technical experts for better maintenance of the stock are also being taken in an attempt to cut into the storage losses, it said.Further, a pilot is being conducted for storage of onion after irradiation in Madhya Pradesh to evaluate the gain on account of shelf life and quality keeping.""It is hoped that this initiative of Nafed will help both the onion growers as well the consumers,"" it added.About onion storage, Nafed said the cooperative this year has added its own operational storage capacity for onions in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh by 30,000 tonne, with the support of state governments.It is in the process of creating more storage space on cluster models at farm gates in the onion growing regions since 2018, it said, adding that this initiative has enabled the Federation to enhance the procurement target, providing market support to the onion growers.Meanwhile, Nafed said it has also approached the state governments to send their requirements of lean months in advance.This will facilitate timely evacuation of the stored onion in a planned manner to have a salutary effect on the retail prices, which tend to go up in the period late August to November.Further, this will help in cutting the storage losses,as long duration of storage entails higher storage loss to the extent of 35 per cent, which gets compounded due to adverse weather conditions, as reported last year, it said.Besides onion, Nafed is procuring pulses for buffer stock."

The All-India CPI-IW for May 2020 increased by 1 point and stood at 330.On 1-month percentage change, it increased by 0.30 per cent between April and May, 2020 compared to 0.64 per cent increase between the same months of the previous year. The maximum upward pressure in current index came from Food group contributing 0.67 percentage points rise to the total change.At commodity level, Arhar Dal, Masur Dal, Moong Dal, Urd Dal, Groundnut Oil, Mustard Oil, Fish Fresh, Goat Meat, Poultry (Chicken), Milk, Cabbage, French Bean, Green Coriander Leaves, Potato, Country Liquor, Refined Liquor, Cooking Gas, Petrol, etc. are responsible for the increase in index, the data showed.However, this increase was checked by Rice, Wheat, Garlic, Onion, Bitter Gourd, Coconut, Gourd, Lady Finger, Mango, Parval, Tomato, Torai, Banana, Kerosene Oil, etc, putting downward pressure on the index, it stated.At centre level, Warangal, Chhindwara and Ahmedabad recorded the maximum increase of 6 points each.Among others, 4 points increase was observed in 6 centres, 3 points in 11 centres, 2 points in 9 centres and 1 point in 8 centres.On the contrary, Doom-Dooma Tinsukia recorded the maximum decrease of 10 points followed by Salem (9 points), Munger-Jamalpur (8 points) and Lucknow (7 points).Among others, 5 points decrease was observed in 1 centre, 4 points in another 1 centre, 3 points in 6 centres, 2 points in 9 centres and 1 point in another 9 centres.

Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said ,""The fall in inflation during the month in general and food in particular due to free supply of cereals to households across the country under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) during lockdown had put less burden on the pockets of 130 crore people in the country.""Lauding the efforts of the Labour Bureau, he said, ""Our labour bureau is doing a great job by bringing out the inflation data during these challenging times under lockdown. This will help policy makers."" The hike in dearness allowance and dearness relief for over one crore central government employees and pensioners is worked out on the basis of CPI-IW."
29,29,2020-07-01,"Rising fuel cost, supply shortage send vegetable prices soaring",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rising-fuel-cost-supply-shortage-send-vegetable-prices-soaring/article31958458.ece,"Disruptions in supply chain and a continuous rise in fuel prices have sent retail vegetables prices soaring in the city.Residents of various suburbs noted that most vegetables were priced at a minimum of 40-50 per kg in retail stores. The price of tomatoes suddenly surged to 70 a kg in some areas this week. Similarly, potatoes were also priced around 50. Onions and cabbage were among the very few reasonably priced ones.R.P. Sundari, a resident of Anna Nagar West, said even pushcart vendors were selling at different prices. Tomatoes cost anywhere between 55 to 70 a kg in our area. We avoid buying beans and broad beans as a kilogram costs above 60. For two people, we spend 250 on a quarter kg of four-five vegetables every two or three days, she said.With meat and fish shops closed during the lockdown, people who consume non-vegetarian food have shifted to a vegetarian diet. This has also led to a spurt in demand and price hike, traders said. Divya Prasanth, of Mogappair, said, Vegetables are expensive now. But I am saving money as meat and fish prices sky-rocketed since the start of the lockdown.Wholesale traders in Thirumazhisai market said fewer arrivals were one of the main reasons that pushed up the prices by 10-20% this week. Moreover, distance of travel for retailers and rise in transportation charges, because of the hiked fuel cost, have also added to the surge. Tomatoes sold for 20 a kg now cost 30 at the wholesale market. Potatoes were now priced 27 a kg. Capsicum and green chillies have jumped to 60 and 40 a kg respectively.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders Associations of KWMC Periyar Market, said retailers travelled an additional distance of minimum 30 km to Thirumazhisai and the wait was six to seven hours longer.Semi-retailers in Koyambedu market have not been allotted shops yet. This has led to a missing link. Retailers, who otherwise bought required quantity, have to buy in bulk and bear the cost of wastage. This is why the wholesale variations do not often reflect in retail prices. For instance, wholesale price of beans and broad beans dropped to 30 and 15 on Tuesday, he added.The wholesale prices were expected to soar as farmers may cultivate less after repeated losses over the past few months, traders added."

Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week."

However, the rush among people to stock up on essentials continued.Most fish sellers, too, were missing from the markets.

Frequent lockdowns seemed to have snapped the supply chain adversely.The price of potatoes increased further. While the Jyoti variety was sold for Rs 32 across the city, Chandramukhi touched Rs 36 on Friday. Most sellers had, however, brought out the smaller varieties of these potatoes sold at a slightly lower price. Onions remained a sore point even on Friday as its price hovered between Rs 30-35, though the fresh quality was yet to be seen in the market till now. Traders blamed the lack of supply.

The bulb is set to become a prized possession with the monsoon playing spoilsport traders say the price of this kitchen essential is due to go sharp north in the days ahead, while the quality will nosedive.They blame the monsoon, flooding and poor inter-state coordination for this. Onion traders say that a kilo of onion, which cost Rs 10, almost doubled during the festive period, after the lockdown was eased and markets were opened. But now the price is likely to shoot up further.At present, 1kg of onion costs Rs 20-30, depending on the size, and is likely to escalate to Rs 40-50; in some places, a superior grade of the bulb costs Rs 50, and could go up to Rs 80. During the festival season, though cost was rising, we didnt escalate the price too much as we feared we would lose whatever little business we were getting after the lockdown was lifted.But now we will be forced to sell at a high price if there is poor supply, said a trader. C Udayshankar, secretary of the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Yeshwantpur, said that most of the retailers did not hike prices during the festival, but now costs are set to rise. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Maharashtra has damaged standing crops.So far, the onion coming from Maharashtra is old stock, and will not last long. The new stock will be moist and have more water content, making them difficult to store for long, he said. Last year too, consumers, farmers and traders had faced a similar situation, where onion quality had dipped and cost was high. Apart from Maharashtra, heavy rain and flooding in North Karnataka will also lead to a price escalation. The picture will be clear after a fortnight, when new stock starts coming in. The stock arriving from Maharashtra is of poor quality and there is no new produce from Karnataka so far, he added."

And this decision has made people think of resuming their exercise regime and getting back into shape. While exercise is the most important to stay fit, a well-balanced diet also plays a very crucial role. For as they say, we are what we eat.Although wed all love to lose weight while not compromising on what we eat, such isnt the case. However, a few simple lifestyle changes and alterations in food habits can work wonders for us, say experts.Nuts is something nutritionist Tripti Tandon swears by: Almonds have the ability to cut down cravings, and also help in weight loss. Yogurt is also a very good superfood. You can add oatmeal, granola or fruits and make it a healthy bowl. You can even add berries, which are rich in antioxidants, as well as nuts, making for a healthy meal. Legumes such as black and red rajma, kala chana, soyabeans are excellent sources of protein, fibre and iron. You can make a chaat out of kala chana or rajma, as it also helps boost immunity.Nuts are a nutritional way to settle those hunger pangs ( Photo: Shutterstock )Have lots of green leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, etc), as they are rich in vitamins and calcium. Also, olive oil can be used, as it is rich in good fatty acids. Whole grains are also very good, as they are rich in vitamins and minerals, and lower cholesterol in the body. Onions, tomatoes and garlic are also superfoods, she says.However, Tandon cautions that no matter how healthy, anything in excess is not good. Insisting on portion control, she also suggests wrapping up dinner early. If you are hungry later, you could have a fruit, some nuts, any herbal tea or a small cup of milk with cocoa, she adds.A key factor for weight gain during the lockdown, according to Ritika Samaddar, a senior dietitian, is binge eating and excessive snacking. We must get back into a disciplined life. During the lockdown, people were getting up late, skipping breakfast, opting for a heavy brunch, etc. Since everyone was at home, people were cooking all sorts of dishes. Therefore, it is important to keep a check on snacking. Opt for healthier options like walnuts, sprouts or a bowl of fruits. Carry a smoothie, as you need a good amount of probiotic. Also, when youre moving out of home, hydration becomes key. Carry detox water, chaach or fresh lime. Also, carry home-cooked food, as when you eat out, you consume unhealthy calories, she adds.Theres nothing quite like a healthy smoothie bowl, to satiate our taste buds ( HT Photo )Samaddar also asserts that people should have breakfast within two hours of waking up. The food that you have for breakfast is also important. It has to be a combination of carbohydrates with proteins. You could start your day with some lukewarm water with honey. You could also opt for ginger water, lemon water, or kadha, she adds.READ: Feeling sluggish? You might be dehydrated!However, in addition to controlling our diet, it is also important to practise mindful eating, says Preeti Rao, a health and wellness expert. Become an intuitive eater. Most people are not connected with their hunger. For example, a baby eats only when it is hungry, and only as much as it needs, with no indulgence. As we grow up, we become less intuitive of our hunger and land up eating just for taste or managing our emotions. Make sure you activate all the sensory organs when you eat. In other words, watch you food, taste your food, smell your food and observe how the food makes you feel in your body. This can happen only if we eat in peace and not with our televisions on or while looking into our phones, she opines.Rao also recommends opting for seasonal produce. Every season brings with it various fruits and vegetables. With increased genetically modified foods, we now have access to our favourite fruits or vegetables all through the seasons. Seasonal fruits and vegetables have properties that suit the climate we are in. For example, summer fruits have more water, which cools the body down. Be educated about the produce you are eating, she suggests.Author tweets @srinidhi_gkFor more stories follow Facebook and Twitter"
