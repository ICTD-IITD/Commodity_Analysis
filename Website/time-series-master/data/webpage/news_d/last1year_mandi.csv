(File photo)NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Are onions still wreaking havoc on your monthly budget? For once, supply issues are not to blame, with around 50 trucks of onions coming in from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Azadpur Mandi every day, each bringing in around 20 tonnes of the essential commodity.The reason why they continue to cost you a bomb then is the high retail and wholesale price differential in Delhi. While the wholesale price currently ranges between Rs 15/kg and Rs 25/kg, retailers are selling onions for anywhere between Rs 40/kg and Rs 60/kg. Usually, sellers keep a margin of Rs 15/kg to account for transportation, storage and other costs. A 100% margin, which even some traders find hard to explain, is biting consumers hard.In Nashik, which is Delhis biggest supplier, the average wholesale price has steadily dropped over the last few weeks. To put things in perspective, it was Rs 1,600/quintal on Friday, a drop of 40% from Rs 2,600/quintal on January 31. The average wholesale price had touched an all-time high of Rs 8,625/quintal on December 16 last year at Lasalgaon APMC, the countrys largest wholesale onion market. Since then, the prices has dropped almost 81%.In the past fortnight, the drop is nearly 64%  from Rs 4,100/quintal on January 20.This decline, however, is yet to reflect in the retail markets of Delhi. In terms of kilograms, when the wholesale price ranged between Rs 60 and Rs 100 from mid-December to mid-January, individual consumers were buying it for anywhere between Rs 80/kg and Rs 120/kg. On Friday, at the roadside stalls near Mata Sundri College in New Delhi, onions were being sold at Rs 50/kg. Similarly, in east Delhis Samaspur, the retail price was between Rs 55/kg and Rs 60/kg. Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller in Samaspur F Block, said the prices had come down by Rs 30-40/kg in a month. Its gradually going down, he claimed.In south Delhis Vasant Kunj, too, the current retail price hovered around Rs 50/kg.Rajan Pal, a seller at Bhogal vegetable market, said at Rs 55, the commodity was far cheaper than it was a couple of months ago when a kilogram cost above Rs 100. . We get onions from Afghanistan and other countries too, but people prefer the Indian version, he said.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, found the high wholesale-retail price differential surprising. There is no shortage of supply in the wholesale market. But the retail prices are much higher than usual, he said, adding that the retail prices were decided by the retailers. The economics of demand and supply determines the prices in the retail markets and there is no mechanism to control them. Factors like location and quality of the product play their part too: in upscale colonies, the retail prices are typically higher.Pintu Mandal, a seller at a market in Govindpuri, said onions were going as high as Rs 60/kg as the wholesale price was still steep. He attributed this to many wholesalers hoarding stocks with an eye on a dip in supply later.According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, there has been a rise in production in all onion-growing pockets of the country in the last one month, but the demand has remained in the same territory as earlier. This has led to a drop in the average wholesale price. Production is good in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu too. This has led to a drop in demand for Maharashtras onions. As a result, the average wholesale onion price has dropped, Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC, said. She said a continuous fluctuations in the wholesale price were also responsible for the selling price not stabilising. The Centre had yet to lift the stock limit on wholesale and onion traders, which had been cut from 50 tonnes to 25 tonnes for wholesalers and from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes for retailers, Jagtap said.The government needs to lift the restrictions on onion traders  both wholesalers and retailers, she added.A source in the Union ministry of agriculture, however, denied that there was any control over retail prices. Some retailers have already purchased onions from the wholesale market and are releasing these gradually. This is the reason for the wide gap. The retail prices will drop gradually, he said."

The price had spiked because of excess rain, which ruined the crop in several parts of the country.With supply stabilising, especially from Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, and exports banned, the rate is now easing, officials said.Consumers may be smiling but farmers are worried as they are not able to make more than Rs 17/kg as against the expected Rs 40.""We get onions from Nasik and Sholapur in Maharashtra. Nasik onions used to be exported but since that is currently banned, they are landing in Bengaluru, leaving the market here with a surplus,"" said K Lokesh, president, Karnataka State Onion Merchants Association.A farmer from Sholapur wh o was part of a onion growers' delegation which met traders in Bengaluru, said, ""The cost of everything has gone up. Labour charges and fuel prices are draining us. How can we survive? How can I pay for my children's education?""Another Sholapur farmer rued: ""My daughter's wedding is in March. How am I going to meet all the expenses? I have to pay for labour, transportation, gunny bags and when everything adds up, I don't get to save more than Rs 30,000 in a month."""
4,4,2020-02-11,Power-operated onion detopper to aid farmers,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/feb/11/power-operated-onion-detopper-to-aid-farmers-2101801.html,"Iffath Fathima ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Onion farmers will probably cry tears of joy over a new invention that mechanically takes some work off their hands.An electricity-operated machine developed by the Indian Institute of Horticulture and Research (IIHR) drastically reduces the amount of time farmers need to de-top onions after harvest.When the onion crop is ready for harvest, the green, leafy tops begin to turn yellow and drop at a point just above the bulb, a process known as neck fall.The tops are cured for 8-10 days and then the onions are manually pulled up by farmers. After this, women would start cutting, separating the leafy part from the bulbs.De-topping is one of the unique operations in cultivation of onion crop and it is tedious, laborious and a time-consuming operation that demands a lot of labour. Farmers have to spend 8-10 hours a day to have the onion de-topped of 800 kg. But with a power-operated onion de-topper, a farmer can have 1.5 tonnes of onions de-topped per hour, said Dr A Carolin Rathina Kumari, Principal Scientist, Division Post Technology Harvest and Agricultural Engineering.The machine consists of a feed conveyor for feeding the cured onion crop, de-topping rollers for shearing the leaves, separate collection chutes for the de-topped onion bulbs and leaves, main frame, power and power transmission system.Dr Carolin said, We worked for four years to develop the machine and the onion de-topper was powered by a three phase, 2 hp, 900 rpm electrical motor with necessary speed reduction gear box. The performance parameters of the onion de-topper were found to be 98% de-topping efficiency.The machine was piloted in districts like Hubballi, Mandya, and Chikballapur, where it worked very well.Dr Carolin said that the state government was impressed by the machine and has procured five machines to present to farmers under the Sujala 3 scheme. The machine has also been evaluated by experts from across the country and will be be patented. Each machine costs Rs 5 lakh, excluding GST and transportation charges."

Retail prices ranged between Rs 25-35 a kilo in the city on Thursday.Arrival of fresh stock is cited as reason for the slump in price. While consumers are happy, traders complain they were staring at losses as they had invested a lot earlier to procure from other States and even abroad.Wholesale traders have requested the Union government to lift the ban on export which is in place since last year.Due to inclement weather, onion cultivation dropped drastically in the State. This resulted in demand skyrocketing and sent prices on an upward spiral.Despite all efforts by the government, the price shot up to as much as Rs 160 a kilo.Grappling with supply chain, the Union government-imposed ban on exports in September 2019 till prices returned to normal. According to onion traders, while the daily requirement for onions is 600 tonnes,less than 50 per cent of it used to arrive in the market. To meet demand, onions were imported from Turkey and Egypt.A Thangaraj, secretary, Tiruchy Onion Wholesalers Association, said, Prices stood above Rs 100 per kg for almost six months, as a result of which sales was affected. With the arrival of harvest season, there is now steady supply, which led to the price drop. Since there is a export ban, cultivated onions from across the state are arriving in markets. Supply now exceeds demand. To handle the situation, the Union government must lift the ban on onion exports."

7,7,2020-03-04,Onion prices expected to rise in Gujarat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/onion-prices-expected-to-rise-as-union-govt-lifts-export-ban/articleshow/74466072.cms,"Picture used for representational purpose onlyRAJKOT: Onion prices are likely to upset budgets of families again.After embargo on exports imposed last year in wake of skyrocketing prices, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has allowed the free export of all varieties of onion from India beginning March 15. The notification issued by the DGFT on March 2 comes following representations from various marketing yards and farmer bodies including Mahuva marketing yard to the union minister of agriculture last month.Traders believe that the onion prices in local markets are likely to increase as a result of export and the crop arrival this year has already been delayed by two months due to prolonged inclement weather last year.In Bhavnagar and Mahuva yard, onion selling at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per 20 kg shot up Rs 470 two days before the news came in that government was likely to allow the export.Narendra Gohil, an onion trader in Bhavnagar yard said, When exports start, we are expect rise in price. At present, onions from Nashik market are pouring in domestic market. One exports begin, the demand for the Mahuva quality onion will increase in domestic market.The government of India had banned onion export on September 29 last year after the prices crossed Rs 150 per kg in retail market. Amreli and Bhavnagar are the two biggest onion producing districts in Gujarat.The normal season for the onion production is January and February, but this year the harvest has been delayed due to prolonged monsoon.According to agriculture department data, the onion sowing area increased to 39,000 hecatre in Gujarat in current financial year from 25,000 ha last year. However the yield is likely to decrease by 30% this year. The onion flood yards during the peak season, but this year we dont expect much yield because of some disease also, Gohil added.Currently, 15,000 bags (each containing 50kg) are coming for auction in Bhavnagar and Mahuva yards. Every year during peak season, 1.50 lakh bags are brought for auction. This year, traders expect around 60,000 to 75,000 bags daily.Vitthal Koradia, an onion exporter said, Generally, the onion crop comes in winter, but this year when the peak season arrives in April, the temperature will be high, which will damage the crop.Ghanshyam Patel, secretary, Mahuva marketing yard said, On February 5, we had represented to the union agriculture minister to allow export."
8,8,2020-03-05,An earthy affair,https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2020/mar/05/an-earthy-affair-2112197.html,"Shwetha Surendran ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: Walking up the staircase leading to Shanthi Sekars house, your nose picks up on that reassuring smell of musty windows and hints of the lunch menu. Greeted at the door by a smiling Shanthi, youre instantly engulfed by the feeling of a home. Her yoga session is done, the lunch table is set and while she waits for her husband to arrive, we sit down for a quick conversation. Married at the age of 15, you could say that Shanthis tryst with cooking began quite early. Away from her friends and family, she turned to food under the strict eye and guidance of her mother-in-law.Shanthi Sekar  Ashwin PrasathShe admits that it was quite a leap  a leap from not knowing the difference between moong and toor dal when she was at her mothers place, into the bottomless cauldron of punchy flavours and succulent meats that is authentic Mudaliar cuisine. A community of cooking that doesnt boast of the popularity of Chettinad flavours or the reviving trend of Kongu flavours, Mudaliar style of cooking is distinct in its rich repast of seafood and poultry. My father and my husband are both seafood aficionados and I grew up eating non-vegetarian food almost daily.They used to head out to the fish markets near Marina Beach early every morning and bring kilos of fish and prawns back home. Fresh meat is the key that defines our cooking, asserts Shanthi. Sura puttu  a stir-fry of minced shark meat mixed with a medley of spices  prawns masala vadai kozhambu, prawns poriyal, kola urundai and appalam kootu  a Mudaliar favourite made out of old papads  are some of the traditional Mudaliar dishes that are now a part of Shanthis repertoire, passed on to her from her mother-in-law. But the nethili kozhambu is the absolute crowd-pleaser.Experimental attitudeThe cornucopia of other ingredients that makes the hidden cuisine sing? Garlic, ginger, curry leaves, pepper, a restrained splash of oil and a pinch of Shanthis homemade masala powder. Ive always ground my own masala powder that I use in most of my dishes. Now I even grind up curry leaves into a powder so that my daughter and grandson eat it without picking it out, says Shanthi. Her experimental attitude to cooking also resulted in a vegan twist to the much-beloved Mudaliar classic aatu kaal paaya (Sheep Trotters curry) with mushroom substituting the protein. Debuting the dish as the main course in her six-course dinner with Chefathon, it was an absolute winner, with requests to recreate it at other events as well.Muscle memoryA culinary journey of over 30 years, Shanthi admits to never writing down recipes now that it has almost become muscle memory. Often sharing the kitchen space with her daughter, it has also become a bonding activity between mother and daughter. I began enjoying cooking only when I began catering to several people as part of my daughters birthday parties. The smiles on satisfied faces is why I enjoy cooking, reminisces Shanthi. The more, the merrier, she adds. Just as we wrap up, her husband, whom she calls her biggest critic, walks in for lunch. A simple lunch table set with sambar, sura puttu and a few poriyals await, and I take my leave.Bottle gourd and prawn poriyalIngredientsBottle gourd: 1 small, Prawns: 250 grams; cleaned and de-veined , Mustard: 1/2 tsp, Split urad dal: 1/2 tsp, Chilli powder: 2 tbs, Turmeric powder: 1/2 tsp, Salt: 1 tsp , Onion: 2 big chopped , Tomato: 1 big chopped , Curry leaves , Coriander leaves, Oil: 2 to 3 tbspCooking instructionsHeat oil in a pan and add in the mustard and split urad dal.When it splutters, add in the chopped onion and saute until it turns translucent.

Order NowPUNE: Onion was auctioned in the range of Rs8-17 per kg at Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard in Gultekdi on Wednesday  the first instance of its wholesale price dipping below the double-figure since the beginning of the ongoing season in January.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials attributed the slump in the onions wholesale price to dip in demand for the produce. Also, they pointed out that the commission agents, who facilitate auction of the farm produce, opened their shops after a break of two weeks. As such, the intake of fresh onion was high in the market.A total of 11,534 quintals of onion arrived in Gultekdi yard on Wednesday. This was more than expected and hence, the prices fell sharply in the open auction, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of vegetables, fruits, onion and potato division of the market yard.He said, Usually, hoteliers and other eateries in the city buy a bulk of onions, but these establishments are closed because of the lockdown. So, there wasnt much demand for onion in the open auction, which drove the price down to the seasons lowest so far. The onions sold at Rs8 per kg was of low standard. But till date, even this type of onion was being sold above Rs12 per kg.The APMC officials claimed that there was adequate supply of kitchen staple, but retail vendors were selling the produce at high price. Outside market yard, vendors are selling onion for anything between Rs35 and Rs40 per kg. People need not worry about the intake or supply at least for next four weeks, Kalamkar said.The wholesale price of potato also took a dip from Rs22-25 per kg two days back to Rs20-22 per kg on Wednesday with 15,281 quintals of potato arriving in the market. The arrival was a surplus, the APMC officials stated.Maximum potato is purchased by vada pav or pav bhaji vendors, which are closed these days. We expect further fall in prices in the coming days, Kalamkar added.The five sub-markets across the city, too, received surplus onion and potato supplies.Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of AFMC, appealed to farmers and commission agents not to bring produce in a large number as only 400 vehicles of vegetables are permitted nowadays every day.Maintaining social distance and avoiding mass gathering is necessary in the current situation. If we get more than 400 vehicles, the market would be crowded and following or implementing the government guidelines would be impossible, Deshmukh said."

Order NowNEW DELHI: Daily labourers and migrant workers living in and around Nizamuddin in the national capital complained of overpriced essentials and vegetables as the police beefed up security in the area after it emerged the biggest hotspot for the spread of coronavirus in India.Onion is retailing at Rs 60/kg, tomato at Rs 50/kg, potato at Rs 40/kg, while other seasonal vegetables are selling at not less than Rs 100-120/kg in the Sarai Kale Khan area, less than 5 km from Nizamuddin West Even dry ration supplies are being sold at higher price. For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi . Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.""Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,"" Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearly Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: ""I don't have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.""Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, ""Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.""Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat 's headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works."

These villages are the main source of labour and are also home to traders who transact in the market.This disrupted supplies across the country. The Lasalgoan market is now set to open on Tuesday, the official said.We at Lasalgaon have decided to resume trading on Tuesday (April 7). The district collector ordered the shutdown because the corona positive case was a major bakery supplier who regularly supplied pav (Indian bread) to the entire area, said Narendra Wadhwane, the secretary of the Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee or APMC.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAPMCs are state-regulated bodies that run wholesale markets in the country under the APMC Act.Onion supplies to rest of India are down 35% due to closure of the financial year in March, lack of labour due to the lockdown and the emergence of the corona case in Nashik. I hope we will have adequate labour when we resume operations, he said.According to the government note, Maharashtra officials have complied a list of all onion traders and suppliers and shared the list to counterparts in various states so that they could directly get in touch with supply agents.While Lasalgaon, a crucial nationwide supplier of onions, shut down due to the coronavirus scare, neighbouring Pimpalgaon, another onion trading hub, had been nearly idle since March 26, Wadhwane said.Too many things coincided. Two cultural events, Gudi Parva and Amawasya, had resulted in diminished trading in the last week of March. The corona case then totally cut off labour, said Prakash Kumawat, the assistant secretary of the APMC market.According to the markets chief Wadhwane, of the 17 APMC markets in Nashik, which is part of a supply chain serving various trading points in the country, only two were open briefly  Lasalgaon and Chandwar.Without labour, wholesale buying and selling came to a halt, he said. He said traders were able to send 40% of shipments.According to a government note accessed by HT, the principal secretary of agricultural marketing recommended market committees to tell farmers to bring harvest pre-packed in gunny backs to speed up trade. These gunny bags come in various capacities, mostly 50kg packs. So its easy to load in the absence of weighmen, said Wadhwane.However, Wadhwane said farmers did not have access to gunny bags. Every establishment was closed due to the corona scare.Since the lockdown, 1,650 truckloads of onions have been dispatched by traders of Nashik district to various parts of the country, which has helped in maintaining in steady supplies, the government note said. According to Wadhwane, thats about 35% less than usual supplies."

Somashekar warned wholesale traders that their licences would be cancelled if they caused unnecessary trouble and confusion during the lockdown. Over the past few days, many traders have been expressing their unhappiness over the governments decision to shift them to more spacious grounds including Dasanapura, which is on the outskirts of the city.Apart from the distance, a bone of contention among traders at Dasanapura is the lack of facilities like parking slots, toilets and a permanent roof. The Minister directed APMC officials to rectify the situation. Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanath, who visited the market on Monday, told The Hindu that three borewells were being dug at the Dasanapura. Many traders who had decided to shut their business have now agreed to continue. We will provide them with facilities, he said.However, C. Uday Shankar, a trader at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, now functioning from Dasanapura, said many onion and potato traders did not conduct business on Monday and would perhaps operate on Tuesday to clear stock. After that, they will resume only after the lockdown, he said.Earlier, , the government had shifted three wholesale markets - Yeshwantpur, Kalasipalyam and Yelahanka - to more spacious places. Onion, potato and garlic traders in Yeshwanthpur are now functioning from Dasanapura, whereas the Yelahanka market has been shifted to Byatarayanapura, and Kalasipalyam to Singena Agrahara. At Yeshwantpur, only whole pulses and cereals traders are being allowed to operate.Mr. Shankar reiterated his stand that the government should allow onion and potato traders to function from Yeshwantpur. Pulses and cereal traders at Yeshwantpur operate on alternate days, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Why cant they permit us to trade on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, instead of shifting us to Dasanapura, which is around 20 kms away, Mr. Uday said."

Similarly, potato was auctioned for Rs15-23 per kg as against Rs12-22 per kg last time.Some traders from Kerala and Tamil Nadu supplied the produce to neighbouring states. Also, police are not restricting goods transport. Thus, traders from other cities, too, are coming to the market. As a result, there was better demand for onion today, said Dattatray Kalamkar, the head of the onion and potato division of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard, adding that a bulk of the produce came from Baramati, Daund and Shirur tehsils.In the fruit market, the supply of mango increased significantly. So, its price came down to the range of Rs1,000-3,000 per box of four dozen of mangoes. Last time, mango was auctioned for Rs3,500-7,000 per box. The market received maximum mangoes from Ratnagiri and some from Karnataka on Monday. Since mango growers are permitted to carry their produce to the market, we expect the similar arrival in the coming days, said Babasaheb Bibave, the head of the fruit division of the market.The price of apple and grapes increased marginally. A kg apple was sold for Rs90-160 as against the previous bazaar rate of Rs80-140 per kg. Grapes were sold in the range of Rs50-70 per kg. However, rates of summer fruits like orange, watermelon and musk melon have remained stable, Bibave added.The price of edible oil dropped on Monday after the wholesale grocery market received its surplus intake of edible oil on Monday.Its price came down to the range of Rs1,250-1,500 per can of 15 litres. In the last bazaar, the prices were in the range of Rs1,100-Rs2,400 per can. We received 27 vehicles of oil from different places on Monday and so there was immediate impact on the rates. This increased intake will ensure stable prices of the oil in the coming days in the city, said Nitin Raskar, the head of the grocery division."

With literally no cold storage facility for onions as seen around Nasik or Pune in Maharashtra, shelf life of the produce in the district gets limited to two weeks at the best.Harvesting is almost coming to a close and at Sudireddypalli and the courtyard of Venkatalakshmamma and Ballary Srinivas is filled with 30 bright red bags of onions ready for delivery to any prospective buyer. But the onion market closed on April 1.A small partially wet lot is out under a semi shade to dry so that it could also be packed.From buying seeds to paying the farm hands at every stage in three months in a three-acre land in the Pasupula panchayat close to Kurnool city, the couple spent 1.10 lakh and had almost struck a deal to sell the produce at 800 a quintal, but now with the market close getting even 500 a quintal was looking difficult.Onions are grown in 1,912 hectares in the district and about 42,000 quintals had arrived at the market so far before closure, Horticulture Assistant Director B. Raghunath Reddy told The Hindu. Efforts were on to enter into a tie-up with buyers and external markets by the Marketing Department to bailout the farmers, he added.While District Collector G. Veerapandian said the administration was sending several trucks everyday to several districts and other States, there were many such growers looking for immediate help.A week before the lockdown was imposed price ruled at 2,800 a quintal and many traders and wholesalers stocked good quantities in the initial days, showing reluctance now to take in more stocks at this juncture. Currently, the onions were available at 25 a kg in the rythu bazaar in Kurnool and 30 a kg in vegetable kiosks in Anantapur.A grower and trader Mulla Mohiddin Saheb, however, says even now there is a demand and stocks are being sent to Gudem, Srikakulam, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Bengaluru and some places in Telangana with the support of the Marketing Department and was able to realise 800 to 1,000 per quintal from Saturday to Monday.Chemical fertilizersDue to the application of chemical fertilizers by Kurnool growers, the demand was lower and the quality of Nasik and Pune onions was much better with a dry outer skin commanding better price, he observed."

Even for kitchen staples such as onions, potatoes and tomatoes, volumes are down over 40%, while other vegetables and fruits have been further affected.The Azadpur Mandi is Asias biggest fruit and vegetable market, spread over almost 44 acres in north-west Delhi. It is home to almost 1,400 shops and handles almost 50 lakh tonnes of produce every year.An analysis of data from the mandis Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee shows that arrivals plunged immediately after the lockdown. Considering six major commodities  onion, potato, tomato, carrots, apples and oranges  only 2,343 tonnes arrived at the mandi on March 25, the first day of the lockdown. The previous day had seen arrival of more than 4,411 tonnes.Despite the governments decision to keep the mandi and to exempt agricultural activity and transport from lockdown restrictions, arrivals remained low for the next two weeks, hovering around the 2,000-tonne mark on most days and dropping to 1,083 tonnes on March 30.For the first week of the lockdown, from March 25 to 30, arrivals of these six commodities dropped 53.27% in comparison to the same period in the previous year. Fruit trade was the most badly hit, with the volume of arriving apples from the northern States crashing more than 83% in comparison to the previous year. Onion and potato arrivals were over 40% lower than the previous year. Tomatoes were about a third of the volume which arrived in the previous year.On Wednesday, responding to concerns about crowding and a failure to practice social distancing at the mandi, the APMC reportedly told traders that they would only be allowed to bring in one truck each per day. The APMC also decided to allow trade in alternate auction sheds only. These moves are meant to prevent the mandi from becoming another hotspot of COVID-19 infections, but are also likely to further reduce the volumes of fruits and vegetables arriving at the mandi.(With inputs from The Hindu Data team)"

While traders and transporters are facing a lot of challenges during the lockdown such as shortage of supply from other districts, drop of market price, transportation constraints, etc, this has added no less to their burdens. The revised rates of toll charges by NHAI came into effect on Monday.We are already facing shortage of lorry drivers due to coronavirus scare. Transportation cost has increased at least by Rs 3,000 - Rs 4,000 per trip. The additional charges will only increase the prices of commodities, said G Subbu, President of the Tiruchy Lorry Owners Association.The cost of vegetables has significantly increased. One kg of potato which was sold for `50 per kg now cost Rs 70-80 per kg, according to traders. The prices have drastically increased in the last couple of days. With the import varied and markets running in a non-regular manner, we have no other option but to hike the vegetables price, said Murugan, a trader at the Gandhi market.Onion price slumpsOn the contrary, onion prices dropped due to lack of export and extreme weather conditions. One kg was sold at Rs 10- Rs 15 as against Rs 40 per kg a week ago.More than 500 tonnes of onions are stuck in the warehouses. Hence, we are dumping at least 30 tonnes of onion every day as they got ruined, said Thangaraj, Secretary of Onion Whole sellers Associations. The wholesalers in the district requested the district administration to permit them to unload onions as and when they arrived and not particularly at nights as they claimed that the weather caused more damage to vegetables packed inside tarpaulin sheets."

It also decided to use idle state bus fleet to ferry essentials and perishables, and also sort out serious drinking water problems.The four-hour emergency meeting of ministers and bureaucrats discussed several critical issues related to the Covid outbreak. The bureaucracy was told to accelerate the administration, noting that development processes has slowed down since the lockdown kicked in in the last week of March. The meeting was held in response to complaints that farmers were losing vegetables and fruits as they did not have storage facilities. Yediyurappa suggested that cold storage was the only solution and that farmers be encouraged to utilise the states facilities. Farmers will also be encouraged to sell their produce to markets in other states and export it.The lockdown has particularly affected mango farmers, for whom this is the season to export to markets abroad and also to other states. It was decided that wherever there was shortage of drinking water, the government would step in to supply water on an emergency basis, and ensure that it is good quality potable water due to the fear of COVID infection.The government also decided to release excess water stored in dams to farmers, to be used for irrigation and drinking purpose. After floods caused serious damage last year, the authorities have been instructed to obtain water availability information from dams. The meeting also decided to expedite setting up of a village-level task force to deal with COVID-related issues at the local level. Union Minister Sadananda Gowda assured the chief minister that farmers would receive fertilisers at lower prices, due to the factors like a dip in international demand.Various organisations that have been granted land but have failed to use it, have been instructed to return the land to the government, especially where lease conditions have been violated. The meeting also decided to encourage domestic tourism to overcome the effects of the sharp drop in the number of international tourists due to the COVID outbreak. Online lessons will be encouraged, and teachers will be instructed to hold classes via internet and television.Banana farmers a worried lotShivamogga: Banana farmers are finding it difficult to sell their produce. They have been selling Yelakki baale for Rs 30 per kg and Pachcha baale for Rs 20 per kg, which was Rs 50-60 per kg and Rs 40 per kg respectively before the lockdown. We used to purchase from growers and sell it in Mangaluru and Udupi markets. Now, both these markets are closed, said Siddalingeshwar of Basaveshwara Mandi.Onion seed prices leave farmers in tearsWith the lockdown triggering shortage of supply of onion seeds, the prices in Mysuru region have soared. Farmers attribute it to restrictions on vehicles coming from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other states to the region. Small onion seeds, that were sold for Rs 35-40 a kilo last year, is now priced at Rs 85 per kg. Now, a farmer has to cough up Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh to grow onion on one acre.PAY HIKE FOR CONTRACT DOCTORSDoctors working on contract with the state government, who are on the frontline battling Covid-19, will receive higher remuneration. The meeting did not take up the issue of hike in the salaries off nurses,ANMs and other medical teams."

Wholesale traders and brokers have been asked to send essentials procured from farmers to Mumbai markets directly, bypassing the Vashi APMC to ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted due to the shutdown of the markets.The decision to shut all five markets was taken after the stakeholders like traders, brokers, transporters and workers expressed unwillingness to work fearing risk to their lives after a spike in number of positive cases reported from APMC market yard in the last few days. A meeting of top bureaucrats was held on Friday at the APMC market to decide the line of action. Various traders bodies also wrote to the APMC administration to shut the market.The decision to shut the market came as a preventive measure as thousands flock the wholesale market daily. Earlier, the Navi Mumbai mayor Jayawant Sutar, NMMC administrator Annasaheb Misal, local MLA Ganesh Naik had demanded closure of APMC immediately in view of rising number of corona cases as the wholesale market has become the corona hotspot in the city.According to APMC sources, a review will be conducted on May 15 to check that whether the situation is conducive to restart the market. APMC deputy secretary Krishnakant Pawar said, During the shutdown we will conduct sanitisation and disinfection of the whole market premises, before the review date.

In Gundlupet taluk alone, onions on nearly 1,000ha are affected by the twister blight. Severely affected areas include Deshipura, Baragi, Hongahalli, Chemmamallipura and neighbouring villages in the taluk.Farmers growing around 80 quintals of onion on an acre, are not able to grow even 30 quintals this year, due to the disease.Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha ( KRRS ) Gundlupet taluk general secretary Mahadevappa said the onions grown on over 300ha in Hangala and two neighbouring villages are affected by the disease. This is the first time that the twister disease has damaged crops in such a large scale. The disease has affected the entire district. Onions are one of the major commercial crops in the district. After the disease started to destroy the crops, we consulted with horticulture department officials. They claim that moisture in the soil is causing the damage, but we have had good yield for years despite heavy rainfall, he said.Farmer leader Mahadevappa said, Farmers, without assistance cannot identify the pesticides to be sprayed for different diseases. They spray the pesticides suggested by agrochemical shops, who in turn recommend only those that fetch them commission. So, if the government wants farmers to grow good crops, they should open agri-clinics with technical assistants, who can guide farmers in every gram panchayat, he said.The current scenario in the district calls for a survey of the onion crop loss, and to ensure that farmers who lost their crop are compensated, he added. Haradanahallis Krishi Vigyan Kendra scientist B Pampana Gowda suggested that farmers spray a mix of water and methyl on the crops. After five to six days, boron, zinc and magnesium should be sprayed, he added."

And thereby hangs a tale.The delicacy that is known to the world as Agre ka petha, is made from ash gourd (known locally as kumbalakai). The sweet is usually made in the North of India, far away from Thirthahalli, but barely a week ago, out of sheer desperation, it began to be made right here. A week ago, Shashank Hegde, also from Thirthahalli, put out an impassioned plea on social media. The 35-year-old posted how farmers had cultivated 2,000 tonnes of ash gourd that should have found its way into Agre ka petha. But with the lockdown, they were left holding the gourd.Warm Welcome Juice by Mallika Badrinath IngredientsWhite pumpkin: 400 gmsCucumber: one or twoCarrots: one or twoTomatoGinger: an inch-long pieceApple: 1Celery: (optional)Karpooravalli leaves: (optional)Salt, white pepperJust a drizzle of honeyMethodWash, peel, de-seed and chop the vegetables.

Suresh pointed out where they were going wrong. Now Vishwanath has around eight to 10 women working on the petha. At the moment, we are manually cutting two tonnes of the gourd. Our target is 10-15 tonnes once the machines take over. We are learning by trial-and-error. I have tasted the pethas but had no idea they were made from gourds grown in my region, says Vishwanath.The process from start to finish takes 72 hours and needs precision. The gourd is cut, washed, soaked in lime for several hours, then again thoroughly washed and boiled. The sugar syrup is made to just the right consistency. The sugared pieces have to dry. We cannot keep them out as even a drop of water will lead to fungus.Vishwanath is buying ash gourd from farmers in need of sales within 10-15 kilometres radius from here. They have no money to harvest, or transport... I am reaching out to them.But just making pethas does not solve the problem. One is unsure how much of it will sell, and 2,000 tonnes cannot all be converted into the sweet. So they are working on a marketing campaign. We plan to send ash gourds to Bengaluru. I have spoken to contacts at various apartment blocks and gated communities.They have requested residents to buy the ash gourds and distribute them to anyone who is struggling to put food on the table.To know more, call 9900602529.

22,22,2020-05-18,Vegetables rot at Thirumazhisai as traders have no storage space,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vegetables-rot-at-thirumazhisai-as-traders-have-no-storage-space/article31618297.ece,"The wholesale traders at Thirumazhisai market, which was opened a week ago and has since been getting a steady supply, are losing 15% of vegetables as wastage for want of storage space.The wholesale vegetable market was shifted from Koyambedu to the temporary facility at Thirumazhisai on May 10.Wholesale traders said steps taken against the spread of COVID-19 has led to another problem. Unable to put up with the long waiting time to enter the market, many small retailers had stopped going Thirumazhisai for purchase. This is forcing wholesale traders to sell the produce at throwaway prices. On an average, the market gets about 4,000 tonnes of vegetables daily. About 500 tonnes goes waste as there is no space to store them.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of Koyambedu Market Wholesale Merchants Association, said this had affected farmers who were bringing produce to the market. For instance, vegetables such as brinjal and ladies finger were sold 5 a kg as there were no takers at the end of stipulated business hours. Even carrots were sold 7 a kg.Farmers suffered a loss because such vegetables must be sold for a minimum of 10 a kg for them to cover labour charges and transportation. These benefits never reach the customers in the city as many retailers dont reduce the price, he said.Onions and potatoes can be stocked better than green vegetables. Moreover, only a section of shops get more business and those at the rear tend to dump vegetables for want of takers. The authorities concerned must help distribute the vehicles entering the market to all shops to prevent wastage, the traders said. They suggested that the government could adopt similar measures with stringent norms and reopen Koyambedu market soon."

His Hyderabad-based enterprise, Kiaro Foods, which started as a dairy production and delivery brand, remodelled itself into a farm-to-home service, within a week of the lockdown. The app-based brand has been able to supply seasonal vegetables and fruits, including much-coveted mangoes during the lockdown.Kiaro Farms setups for bringing fresh produce to different parts of Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath shares, Letting good produce that wasnt going out of Telangana rot seemed like not only a waste but also meant we werent utilising our existing logistics the right way. After much thought we redesigned our app and introduced same-day harvested vegetables. The re-branding exercise was driven by the need to help farmers, so that their hard work and produce would not go waste. In the process, ledgers and accounts have gone for a toss, as they focussed on sourcing and logistics as the lockdown came as a bolt from the blue.A young woman with her selection of fresh produce and baked goods from Kiaro Foods, Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Kiaro FoodsSharath says, At first, we sourced and sold produce without grading; we are not very proud about that. However, we learnt from our mistakes and reworked the system and started grading the vegetables and fruits. Then we sourced eggs from an exporter and started selling them through the app. Soon we realised there was a huge demand for bread, wheat, fruits. We literally rebuilt ourselves on the basis of demand. Our motive was to make sure people get what they need. The breads we supply are from an upscale confectionery thats known for its desserts; the wheat is also from an exporter who had a big amount of fresh wheat that couldnt be exported due to lockdown.Prabalika M BorahHobby turns into needThe Prodigal Farms, NoidaPuneet Tyagi and Neha Bhatia started farming as a hobby four years ago, and soon turned it into a business, first with farm-to-fork weekend experiences and zero-waste workshops, and now with home delivery of their produce that is free of inorganic additives. We have six farmers working with us, four of whom are women. Their husbands lost their jobs, and so came to the farm; we were able to employ them to deliver the produce, says Puneet. He says the vegetables are harvested and packed into boxes by the farmers and they would be loaded and delivered by another set of people, ensuring minimal handling.Initially, they needed to realign deliveries only to Noida, but have now worked out a system of delivering across Delhi-NCR (theprodigalfarms.com/farmstore). Because orders had drastically reduced, and they had a lot of produce, they began making home processed foods like pickle, which people can order. Puneet says the lockdown has helped bring the farmers in the neighbourhood together and many have shown an interest in halting the use of artificial pesticide and fertilizer.Sunalini MathewFarm platformKrishi Cress, Chattarpur and FaridabadAchintya Anand, a chef and first-generation farmer, began five years ago, by supplying produce to restaurants and hotels. The lockdown saw demand from the hospitality sector dip to almost nothing.Within a week or so of operation, the website, orders.krishicress.com, which had been ready, went up for home-delivery orders. We had been trying it out for a year, but we had a small presence, says Achintya. Now, orders have doubled, but the cost of logistics poses a challenge. Also, there are two farms, in Chattarpur and Faridabad, so coordinating transportation has not been easy. Another challenge has been maintaining hygiene protocols and implementing changes overnight.We are very lucky because a lot of our staff stay at the farm, so theres minimal contact from the outside; the rest all live close by. Also, as we are located in a remote area, we had started a pick-up and drop facility before the first lockdown, he says.What remains popular are his salad and microgreens, as well as the value-adds like kombucha and red pepper chilli jam, whether for households or restaurants, some of which have begun delivery-based kitchens. Hes got orders from a few because, People are extremely conscious of what is going into their food now. While demand is growing, they are managing with existing capacity: Its difficult to build capacity at this time, says Achintya.He sees the lockdown as an opportunity to promote agri-businesses that grow crops free of chemical residue, and push for new hygiene-driven protocols and practices. Eventually, he would like to see farmers band together into a cooperative and set up a platform where the produce goes from farm to table. The focus needs to be on post-harvest handling. We produce fruit and vegetables as good as any in the world, as long as theyre on the tree or plant. Its what happens after: the storage, the cold chain maintenance. As for the future: I dont want to take any calls for the future. Even the chefs dont know when their restaurants will be up and running.Sunalini MathewFor a fair dealHFPA, BengaluruThe son of agriculturist Shekhappa, Jagadish Sunagad owns 15 acres of land at Baluti near Bijapur. His entrepreneurial skills have helped thousands of farmers in North Karnataka. I cannot get over the onion and watermelon losses this season, says Jagadish. I have an MBA, and being a farmer myself, I understand the farmers need to reach their produce to the right quarters. They need guidance in growing and getting the right subsidies.Jagadish, CEO of Basavana Bagewadi Horticulture Farmer Producer Company (HFPA) in Kolhar taluk of Bijapur district, has released nine videos on social media to help farmers. We have 1,000 farmers from 22 villages in the North Karnataka belt in HFPA. Karnataka has nearly 100 Farmer Producer Organisations with about 1,000 farmers, who swung into action to help crops reach consumers. I worked from Kolhar taluk to minimise losses for onion, watermelon, banana and maize. Jagadish arranged for nearly 100 tonnes of vegetables and fruits to reach cities every week.Transportation and labour were herculean tasks, but we saw to it that losses were restricted to about 50%. I roped in my family too; they accompanied the trucks. A farmer associate, Girish Telage, had six truckloads of watermelon worth 96,000. In Shivajinagar, he was offered 30,000. I intervened and re-routed the trucks to Yeshwantpur, Goraguntepalya, Peenya and Rajajinagar markets and got him a 20,000 profit.The best deal, according to Jagadish, was the direct FPO-to-FPO exchange programme, where vegetables and fruits were bartered depending on requirements from farmers in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Onions (500 tonnes), watermelon (400 tonnes) and 200 tonnes of potato did not go waste, thanks to this arrangement, although pricing was heavily compromised.Ranjani GovindCultural redemptionSolitude Farm, AurovilleWhy are we eating cabbage, broccoli, and beetroot and not more sundakkai (turkey berry), vazhapoo (banana blossoms), and karunai kizhangu (yam)? This is among the many questions Aurovillian farmer Krishna McKenzie wants us to ask ourselves. According to him, the pandemic and resulting lockdown has been a catalyst in making us understand that a centralised system is not the most practical, or efficient answer our food needs. Deprived of vegetables when the existing food supply system faltered, he says that people are now waking up to local farming and local distribution.Krishna Mckenzie | Photo Credit: splThe 47-year-old Englishman, through his Solitude Farm in Auroville, has been at the forefront of what he calls a cultural redemption by reminding people of their traditional knowledge, particularly of food and the politics that surrounds it. He has been on his feet during lockdown, setting up kitchen gardens, as well as giving away keerai cuttings, saplings, and seeds to those looking for ways to start their own vegetable patch.More and more people are connecting with me now; just yesterday, someone came to take home murungai keerai (moringa) and vazhathandu (banana stem) cuttings, he says, adding that there has been an increase in the number of organic food baskets he sends out to Auroville and Puducherry. I have been helping people at their gardens, many of them are now thinking about growing their own food. They now have more time than they usually would. Krishna points out that people in his neighbourhood are coming together to share their produce.Krishna has been posting videos on social media on how to better employ urban spaces for vegetable gardening, as well as how to cook local vegetables. He says, This pandemic has been a wake-up call; it has shown us that the need for food is the common adhesive in the system; that food is one.Akila KannadasanSeeds of hopeSwadeshi Karshika Vipani, ThiruvananthapuramThe weekly agro bazaar in Thiruvananthapuram, Swadeshi Karshika Vipani, sells produce procured from organic farmers across the district. The maximum produce for this comes from Perumkadavila in Neyyattinkara, on the outskirts of the city. The closure of the market due to lockdown meant there was no avenue to sell the produce for these farmers.V Sreekumaran Nair, president of Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma | Photo Credit: Special arrangementThat is when V Sreekumaran Nair, president of the Facebook group Thiruvananthapuram Karshaka Koottayma, which is one of the driving forces behind this agri market, came up with a solution. He took orders via WhatsApp, collected produce from 14 farmers in the area and home-delivered the vegetables and fruits to regular customers in two autorickshaws.Produce from Sreekumaran Nairs farm kept for sale | Photo Credit: Special arrangementFour of us coordinated the supply. We have nearly 100 regular customers and could deliver the produce to about 40 of them. We did that until lockdown restrictions were made strict. After that, we started selling produce through an eco-shop with the support of the regional agricultural office and Panchayat officials. Now the produce gets sold at our farms itself, says Sreekumaran, who cultivates on over 2.5 acres. In addition, he has given away seeds and saplings for free.I have distributed them to 214 households and 80% of them are taking up farming for the first time. Since many of them are taking baby steps, I have distributed seeds of tomato, ladys finger, long beans, amaranthus, and brinjal that can be easily grown. Many came all the way from the city on two-wheelers to collect the seeds. There has been a renewed interest in farming and now many people seek help to set up kitchen/terrace gardens, he says. When I give away the seeds, I tell them that each has a life growing inside it and they have a responsibility to take care of it, he adds.Athira M"

Upon closer look, it becomes clear that the imposing canyon is a slice of burnt bread, and the highline from which the subject is hanging is a string of gooey cheese in this photograph by Kristen Nelson. I created a scene of me falling while highlining in a grilled cheese canyon, she says over an email interview from Los Angeles.Ziplining through a broccoli forest | Photo Credit: Kristen NelsonHer other creations include ziplining through the Costa Rican rainforest (recreated using broccoli), walking in a winter waffle land, riding through a celery forest on a cycle made of tangerine, cheese, pasta and onions, backpacking through a can-yon.These outdoorsy pictures are part of the #ourgreatindoors page started by Los Angeles-based photographer, Erin Sullivan, which challenges photography enthusiasts to shoot images recreating the outdoors with whatever they have at home.Erin SullivanErin started recreating outdoor scenes in late March and has completed more than 18 so far. The idea came about as a response to the stay-at-home order in California, USA. I have used pillows, paper bags, broccoli, sugar, paper, pancakes, cotton balls, tin foil, jello and asparagus, says Erin, confessing that each scene she creates feels equally bizarre to her. Her most quirky creations so far have been a jello lake with an asparagus forest set in a pie dish, and onion hot tubs.Onion hot tub | Photo Credit: Erin SullivanI began asking myself how I could remain creative and connected to the outdoors and travel, adds Erin, who is constantly on the move and has travelled to around 30 countries.Soon after creating the first few scenes, she felt that this could be a great project to share with her community. And that is how #ourgreatindoors started.I almost always share my behind-the-scenes images, so that people know how they are made. Under the hashtag, we have hundreds of images of what people have created, and some are super original, she says.The recreated scenes include well-known places like Death Valley and Yosemite National Park in the US, Banff National Park and Moraine Lake (Canada), the Dolomites (Italy), glaciers and ice caves of Iceland, the Amazon rainforest, and lots of other scenes depicting rivers, camping sites, ships in the ocean, Northern Lights and starry nights. Each setup and shoot can take between 10 minutes to a few hours, depending on how complex it is.Star trails | Photo Credit: Albert BakerAlbert Baker, a landscape and travel photographer based out of Las Vegas, USA, says it took him a few days to get one of his images right. The most challenging was creating star trails and trying to figure out how to do so without actually using the real stars, he says, adding, Im actually still not happy with it.Up for the challengeFor Albert, perspective is the biggest challenge and he is picky about the image. I use a wide aperture lens and use an object closer to the camera and further away... so that when I focus on the figure, the blurred effect of the surroundings creates a realistic look, making it seem like I was actually on location shooting the photo, he explains.Albert trying to create a waterfall sequence using cling wrap | Photo Credit: Albert BakerAlbert enjoys challenges, which explains why he spends time trying to create elements like fog for instance or a waterfall, to add drama to his pictures. I used a humidifier and an empty picture glass frame to create fog, and cling wrap and acrylic sheet for a waterfall with minor setting changes on the camera, he adds.Kristen NelsonBut for Kristen, who has created 19 scenes so far, her most complex work was a canoe in an Alpine lake with mountains made of Hersheys Kisses chocolate surrounding the lake. She even used dill leaves, something she had never heard of till the shoot. While editing, I tried a lot of things and ended up redoing most of it. It took me over five hours. But the challenge just made the process more engaging and the end result more rewarding, she says, adding that she can no longer look at the objects in her fridge the same way. The ideas kept flowing, so I kept creating. Its been a lot of fun, she says.While the creative process might be satisfying, what is not as fun is the part that involves cleaning up. Most of the scenes havent required me to make a huge mess, but others have for sure, says Erin.Albert BakerAlbert, who has done 17 scenes so far, has decided to take a little break, considering how messy his house gets. But he is already planning his next shoot: something from the Arches National Park. He says: What else would I be doing without it? I thank Erin for creating it. This exercise has brought back memories of being a kid again when I used to build scenes for my action figures."
25,25,2020-05-24,Wholesale veggie prices crash during lockdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wholesale-veggie-prices-crash-during-lockdown/articleshow/75927840.cms,"In the two months since the country went into lockdown, vegetable prices have crashed in wholesale markets across states. The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others."

Eid al-Fitr means festival of breaking the fast and it marks the end of 30-day Ramadan. Just like Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr starts with the sighting of the new moon, and Muslims around the world await to sight the crescent moon on Ramadan 29 or Ramadan 30 to be sure of the date. The dates for Ramadan and Eid change as per the Islamic calendar. Eid is not just a time for celebrations and feasts, but also a time when one remembers Allah and thank him for all his blessings. Zakat (charity) is offered on Eid as well as throughout Ramadan, so that we get the opportunity to share our joys with those who are less fortunate.Food is one thing that binds everyone amid festivities globally. Family and friends get together, cook traditional recipes, and enjoy the feast with all their near and dear ones. From biryani, to kebabs, sheer mal and kheer, here are a few recipes that you can make to celebrate the festival.Biryani:Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, meaning fried before cooking. There are multiple theories about how biryani came to India, after having originated in Western Asia.One legend has it that Timur, the Turk-Mongol conqueror, brought the precursor to the biryani with him when he arrived in India in 1398. An earthen pot full of rice, spices and all available meats would be buried in a hot pit. This was then dug up and served to the warriors in Timurs army.Another legend has it that the dish was first brought to the southern Malabar coast by Arab traders who were frequent visitors there. Records of a rice dish known as Oon Soru in Tamil literature have been found dating back to as early as the year 2 A.D. Oon Soru is said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf, and was used to feed military warriors.However, the most popular story traces the origins of Biryani Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahans beautiful queen who inspired the Taj Mahal.Traditionally, the dum pukht method (slow breathing oven in Persian) of cooking biryani used. In this method, the ingredients are loaded in a pot and slow cooked over charcoal, sometimes also placed on the top of the vessel to allow the dum or steam to blend all the flavours together. The pot is sealed around the edges with dough (atta) which allows the steaming meat to tenderise in its own juices while also flavouring the layers of rice.Meat or chicken is often the main ingredient in biryani, although in some coastal varieties, fish, prawns, and crabs are also used. Vegetarians too have options such as mixed veggies, soya chunks in a veg biryani. Use of rose water, sweet edible ittar and kewra water is still prevalent in biryani cooking since the medieval era.Mughlai biryani, Hyderabadi biryani, Calcutta biryani, Dindigul biryani, Lucknowi biryani, Arcot biryani, Memoni biryani, Thalassery biryani, Kampuri biryani, Tahari biryani, Beary biryani, Sindhi biryani, Bhatkali biryani, Bombay biryani, Doodh ki biryaniare the varieties that are cooked in India across regions.Almond Mixed Grain BiryaniIngredients1/2 cup Barley washed & drained, 1/2 cup Brown rice, washed & drained, 1/2 cup Pearl Millet, washed & drained, 2 tsp Ghee, 1 tsp Garlic, Chopped, 1 tbsp Ginger, Chopped, 1 tsp Green Chilli, Chopped, 1/2 cup Baby carrots, diced 1/4 cup Onion red, sliced, 1/2 tsp Salt to Taste Black Pepper, Crushed, 7 cups Vegetable stock, 1 tsp Cumin seeds , 1 tsp Chopped Coriander, 1 tsp Chopped Spring Onion, 1/4 cup AlmondsMethodHeat ghee in a large dutch oven/pot over medium heat.

27,27,2020-05-27,Haryana farmers in dismay over deep plunge in onion prices,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-in-dismay-over-deep-plunge-in-onion-prices/story-ymbxiaoGVobiq5jT5Mp8nI.html,"chandigarhUpdated: May 28, 2020 01:25 ISTOnion farmers across the state are in dismay as wholesale prices have crashed drastically and they are unable to cover the input cost amid the lack of buyers.Onion had dominated the headlines in October last year due to its skyrocketing prices, as it was sold for 100 per kg. But now, farmers are being forced to sell it for 7- 9 per kg in the absence of buyers. This has made them question the system of marketing vegetables in the country.The traders and farmers blame the Covid-19 lockdown for the fall in rates. The farmers revealed that big transporters and buyers were not showing interest in onion due to which they were unable to sell their entire produce in the local markets.In the absence of big traders due to the lockdown, we have been selling the crop to local merchants and street vendors. This is the reason why the prices have crashed to around 8 per kg from 14 per kg last year, said Raj Kumar, a trader from Pipli onion market in Kurukshetra.As per the traders, the Pipli mandi is the biggest onion market in the northern districts of Haryana and most farmers, even from Punjab, come here to sell their produce in hope of better prices. As there is no mechanism to store the produce, the farmers have no choice but to sell it even if at lower prices, said another trader Praveen Kumar, adding that there is no possibility of rise in the prices as the harvesting is in its last leg and most of the produce has already been purchased.However, the fall in prices has appalled the farmers.I sowed onion on two acres of land and yielded nearly 110 quintals per acre, hoping for handsome returns. But it was unable to fetch me even the input cost which is around 50,000 per acre, rued farmer Raj Kumar from Fatehgarh village of Yamunanagar district.Farmers also claimed that they had to purchase nurseries at higher prices this year.This year, the production cost has doubled as the farmers had to purchase onion nurseries at higher prices. Also, there has been also a dip of about 10-20 quintals in per acre yield due to untimely rainfall. Farmers have not been able to earn much so far this year, said Vijay Kumar, a farmer from of Kurukshetras Kaserla village.As per state horticulture department officials, due to the increase in the onion prices last year, the onion acreage has increased to over 36,000 hectares from 32,000 hectares and its production to around 8.77 lakh MT against the 7.80 lakh MT from last year."

APMC officials attribute the decline to decline in demand, coupled with unsold inventory and even a bumper harvest of the crop.Onion prices declined 50% against last year as consumption took a hit. About 20% of the stock of onions which arrives at the APMC is left unsold and as a result, the traders have started ordering less quantity of onions, said a source at the APMC.Similar is the case with green chillies, capsicums and tomatoes. The demand for green chillies dropped by 30% and consequently, the prices too declined to settle in the range of Rs 12-30 per kg, said a wholesale trader.Traders have attributed the decline in price to the dropping of wholesale consumption at hotels, restaurants and eateries. The hotel industry is completely closed due to the lockdown and despite relaxations by allowing takeaway orders, the business hasnt resumed as much due to which the demand is very low. Moreover, this year, the production of onion has gone up by 10% against last year. Both these factors have contributed to the decline in prices, said a trader.When contacted, sources in the hotels and restaurants industry said that barely 20% of the restaurants have been able to resume operations through takeaway models and the order volumes too have drastically declined. As a result, the consumption of vegetables is bound to go down.Officials at APMC Ahmedabad said that on Wednesday, barely 537 quintal of onions were traded against 1,800 quintals traded usually. The dealers had enough stock of onions to meet the days demand and thus, only 336 quintals from Maharashtra and 201 quintals from Mahuva was procured, said a senior official."

My cousins and I spent glorious afternoons on the terrace of our grandparents ancestral home, squinting under the sun, listening to the twittering birds, and watching the large jackfruit and tamarind trees shimmering, declaring the arrival of summer.Also jostling for our attention, the mango trees blossomed, filling the air with the rawness of its fruit. At the other end of the terrace, sitting around heaps of raw mangoes freshly plucked from these trees, our mothers, aunts and uncles exchanged juicy bites of family gossip. In another corner, paati exercised her arms in laying out vadams, vathals, and slices of lemon, tomato and gooseberry to dry on thathas white cotton veshti. And our task was to keep the usual thieving birds at bay.Summer rituals deserve that extra bit of praise, dont they?While this years summer arrived with a pall of coronavirus-induced gloom, the spirit of Chennai folk, however, seemed to hand out a promise of not losing this tradition to a pandemic. Soaking in this sunshine, the city began preparations for its version of preserves for the year.Pickling memoriesLockdown or not, certain things dont change. I began with my usual pickle-making process in the first week of April. My daughter-in-law, daughter and grandchildren helped me this year. What used to be a solo ritual turned into a family bonding exercise and Im grateful that this generation is getting to enjoy these activities. Weve made gooseberry, lemon, raw mango and vegetable pickles. Ive also made vadam (rice crackers) using rice, sago and maize, because I had an extra set of hands to help me out, says 80-year-old Bhooshanam B, who has been labouriously but lovingly continuing this summer ritual for the past 50 years.This year, however, Bhooshanams duty has been simply to guide and monitor. Division of labour was introduced. The grandchildren Karthik, Nisha and Chandru  were tasked with washing fruits and vegetables for making pickles. Her daughter-in-law Shanmathi sliced and marinated them; her daughter Sithara mixed the pickle in vinegar and filled them into jars with labels for each. Usually, when the pickle is ready, the grandchildren deliver the goodies to friends and neighbours. This year, due to the lockdown, we could distribute the pickles only to a select few. Also, I couldnt get access to the usual variety and quality of vegetables. Weve prepared a batch with whatever was available and stocked up on pickles for the next few months. The kids realised how difficult and time-consuming pickle-making is, shares the octogenarian.Family recipes unlockedPickles, preserves and podis are not just condiments. They are emotions. And no one knows this better than our grandmothers and mothers who have guarded their heirloom recipes close to their heart like a family member. So, being party to this secret required consistent display of enthusiasm and the promise of never failing the recipe. But in the case of sisters Sundari Raman and Shwetha Raman, it took a pandemic to convert the new homebirds into kitchen ninjas. Both of us have been wanting to do this every year. We just procrastinate in the name of work.Im usually busy with taking summer coaching classes for students and Shwetha has a morning shift. This was the first time we were involved in the making process and its been completely worth the effort. Weve made hand-pounded garlic powder, sambar powder, and chutneys and thokku made of watermelon and orange peels. Cauliflower and peas pickle has been our familys heirloom recipe for many years. Weve made many jars of it and given it to our neighbours. Theres a certain sense of satisfaction when you make everything from scratch. This has been of great help to amma as well, says Sundari.Ditching comfortBrothers Bharat Ram and Ananth Ram have been using this quarantine to commune with spices and all things summer-nice. This lockdown has been an eye-opener to us. Our parents stay in Madurai and were stuck in Chennai. Both of us work at an automobile firm. We usually take a summer break and go to our hometown for a week. Since that was not possible, weve taken it upon ourselves to learn cooking during this time. Amma teaches us simple recipes over video-calls. Ananth is fond of pickles, so he made a simple cut-mango pickle; he also learnt to make onion crackers from dad, who is an expert at it, shares Bharat.Growing up, the brothers have seen the kitchen duties be equally divided between their parents. While their mother does the everyday cooking, their father anchors all the pickle and vadam-making activities. We did not do even the basics such as washing mangoes when we all lived under the same roof. The situation has pushed us to step out of our comfort zones to get a hands-on experience. Its been an exciting journey for two months now. We live in a single bedroom apartment. Some of the aunties in our neighbourhood appreciated us when they saw us drying the vadams, and fruit peels to make pickles on the terrace, early morning. Were managing with minimum ingredients, putting them to good use, shares Ananth, gushing with excitement.Jars of nostalgiaFor sisters Janani Ravi and Preethi Ravi, summer is about taking a break from being city slickers and visiting their hometown near Theni, to dig their teeth into their ammas summer specialities. But caught in the confines of the lockdown, the duo has been eating bites of nostalgia this year. Not a day went by without thinking of moms dry fish crackers and prawn pickle. I usually take leave for a week while my sister has a two-month-long vacation. Shed help amma with preparation from the first week of April. Back home, we live in an independent house and wed keep the materials for drying on the porch, in the backyard and on the terrace. We do not get that comfort here living in an apartment. Wed bring back more than 10 bottles of these non-vegetarian pickles and boxes of vadams for our friends, says Janani. Not willing to be separated from their staples, the duo decided to make their fix with instructions from their mother on video-calls.We made a batch of fish and prawn pickle along with rice and dry fish crackers. Mom instructs and I follow. Since Im used to helping her often, I find it easier. She is equally upset that she wasnt able to make pickles in large quantities and distribute it to family members this year. Moms pickles are sought-after by family and friends. But it was fun preparing everything from scratch. Non-vegetarian pickles are more time-consuming. We have to devein the prawn, grind the masala with roller stone (that we bought recently), marinate for weeks in oil and rock salt, and only then devour. The quality of seafood and cost also varies. Most of our meals comprise only pickle and curd rice. Its filling and works out to be economical. Its considered to be a divine combination even at home, says Preethi.Lessons for lifetimeThe lockdown, however, has been a blessing in disguise for Parul Bhatt in fulfilling her summer duties. The lockdown was announced just before we were to go abroad with my daughter and grandchildren whod come for a vacation. What wouldve otherwise been a mundane pickle-making session was filled with laughter and enthusiasm shown from the little ones. I involved them in simple tasks such as cleaning, drying, that do not involve fire or sharp objects, says Parul, who started her brand Paruls Magic three years ago.While the pandemic continues to stay stubborn, Paruls plans are anything but foiled. Keeping up the annual tradition, this year too she prepared eight varieties of her ancestral Gujarati pickles, including mango, chundo, lemon, garlic, methiya keri, channa and capsicum. Whats special about them? They are all hand-picked seasonal vegetables pickled in minimal oil and seasonings. The feisty grandmom and her grandchildren have been busy separating the spices, scraping the peels of veggies and preparing them to dry on the terrace.This is the right age to keep children focussed and train them in the kitchen; they are sharp. They taste and tell me how much salt and spice is required. Im passing on the legacy to my grandchildren, just the way my grandmother once passed it on to me. This lockdown is a gentle reminder for us to slow down, calm ourselves and get back to the basics, says Parul. Truly so. Even as the COVID clouds continue to loom, this summer comes with a promise from these families that traditions and rituals emerging from the kitchen will always be pickled in the fragrance of legacy.Minimalist staplesPicklesRaw mango varieties, Cut-raw mango pickle, Grated raw mango pickle, Avakai pickle, Narthangai pickle, Lemon pickleVathal or rice crackersPuffed rice vathal, Leftover rice vathal,Sago vathal, Mor milagai,Onion vathal"

After months of soaring prices, touching almost Rs200 a kilogram, it is now selling at Rs 25 in most retail markets and online stores. And if you shop in Koyambedu, the prices could be up to Rs 5 less.Besides import, the new onion crop has brought down the prices drastically. The exhorbitant cost of the kitchen staple had affected food prices in eateries and even led to onion thefts. Since the onion yield now is good, the market is again getting supplies from Nasik, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We are back to normal. We have more supply than the demand. So, cost has come down, said R Sounderrajan, head of the Koyambedu Onion Trader Association.Cost of other veggies such as tomatoes, beans, carrots, capsicum and cauliflower are also low. While a kilogram of radish and bottle gourd is retailing at Rs10, tomatoes and okra cost Rs12 per kg, premium quality of cauliflower and a kilo of beans is sold at Rs20. They cost up to Rs5 lesser in Koyambedu, said Rajesh Kumar, who has a retail shop at Koyambedu market.Almost nearing the end of season, peas is being sold at Rs35 a kg, butter beans at Rs100 and double beans at Rs80. Spicy ingredients like green chillies and ginger are also easy on the pocket at Rs15 per kg.The only vegetable still causing a heartburn for households is the drumstick at Rs110 per kg. One stick costs Rs12 even in Koyambedu, said Sounderrajan. But in a few weeks it will come down to Rs10 for three to five sticks. Soon, we will have a good harvest within the state, he said."

(File Photo) A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with. (File Photo)The Pune Municipal Corporation has sought the expertise of police investigators in the use of technology for tracing the likely contacts of a person declared infected with the COVDI-19 disease.Rahul Jagtap, incharge of information technology wing at the PMC, said these days crime investigation relies heavily on technology, and police teams are very skilled at tracing the whereabouts and the likely contacts of a criminal.We are exploring whether those same skills of the police can be used in tracing the persons who might have come in contact with a person infected with Coronavirus. We have shared the mobile phone number of some of the infected people in the city with the cyber crime cell for assistance in tracing their contacts, he said.A civil health officer said, the local authorities were finding it extremely difficult to find each and every person an infected person could have come in contact with, especially in the case of people who start showing symptoms only after a few days.It is noticed that many infected persons do not show symptoms initially and freely move around. They are tested and confirmed as positive cases, only after they show symptoms after a few days. In such cases, contact tracing gets very difficult. But we also have to ensure that no possible case of spread of the virus is left out, the officer said.Vegetable prices soar as markets closed till March 31On a day when markets in the city were shut except those dealing in essential commodities, prices of vegetables skyrocketed on Monday amid high demand and shrinking supply.Traders and vendors said people were panic shopping created by the fear of shutdown, following the spread of COVID-19.Onion, potato, green vegetables, coriander, green chillies were sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 more than the rates they were being sold until the weekend.The supply of vegetables has gone down while the demand is high, as people are purchasing in large quantities, said an official from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) that runs Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard.Taking advantage of the situation, local vendors too have hiked the vegetable prices.

35,35,2020-04-09,Social distancing takes a back seat at markets,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/social-distancing-takes-a-back-seat-at-markets/article31302590.ece,"A few days ago, the authorities shifted Raithara Santhe, the farmers market near Yelahanka, to a vacant plot opposite the University of Agricultural Science, Bengaluru. The aim was to ensure that the market had more space to operate and facilitate social distancing, one of the practices that helps curb the spread of COVID-19.At the new location, barricades were erected, police personnel were deployed at entry points, and announcements urging people not to crowd were made regularly. But, these measures have had no impact on most consumers, who, after failing to maintain any distance from fellow shoppers return to their homes to self-isolate.Every day, hundreds of people come here in their private vehicles to buy vegetables and fruits. We insist that they maintain distance while making purchases. Only some people listen, said a police constable on duty.The government officials were also seen appealing to people with little success. Please do not come here to purchase vegetables every day. Buy enough for a week, said one government official. For many residents, the visit to the market is a family outing. Three to four members from one family come in a car. People need to understand that this is not a picnic spot. We are going through a difficult time, the official added.Priya U., resident of Sahakarnagar, said: In this market, we can purchase vegetables at comparatively cheaper rates as we get it directly from farmers. But the absence of social distance is cause for concern. The authorities are doing their best and people should cooperate.Rain adds to woesOther markets, including wholesale ones, are facing similar problems. Onion and potato traders from Yeshwantpur APMC yard were shifted to Dasanapura APMC due to lack of space. However, traders at Dasanapura say that though the ground is vast, there are no measures taken to ensure social distancing. This defeats the purpose of shifting the market, a trader said.Traders estimate that there are 400 poople operating from Dasanapura. Hundreds of lorries and trucks of farmers and traders come here, said a trader. A trader at Singena Agrahara, where the Kalasipalyam wholesale market has been shifted, said: The whole place is filled with slush due to the recent rain.Rajendra Kumar Kataria, secretary to government, Agriculture, Horticulture and Sericulture, underscored the need for people to cooperate and defended the governments decision to shift the markets. Earlier, Raithara Santhe was operating in an area that is less than two acres of land. Maintaining social distancing was next to impossible there. After shifting to the the new place, the distancing is improving, he told The Hindu.He added that the State government was taking various measures to decongest the markets.In Bengaluru, 480 HOPCOMS stores had increased procurement from farmers. HOPCOMS mobile units have started selling vegetables and fruit in residential apartments and other designated clusters.We are also encouraging food processing units and agencies doing large procurements both in the State and outside to make direct purchases from farmers. This would reduce crowding at markets to a great extent, he said."
36,36,2020-06-13,Queen of rasam,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/rasam-queen-usha-prabhakaran-is-ready-to-launch-her-rasam-digest-that-has-1000-rasam-recipes/article31820896.ece,"No other Indian dish can claim to have medicinal value in each of its ingredients. That honour belongs to the humble rasam (meaning: essence). No wonder, then, that rasam has emerged as the most popular dish during COVID-19 lockdown.Apart from being the simplest dish, one can prepare rasam with minimal ingredients, and it can be had as soup or mixed with rice and eaten. But preparing rasam requires knowledge, expertise and experience, says 64-year-old Usha Prabhakaran, author of the soon-to-be-launched Rasam Digest, a book with 1,000 different rasam recipes.A lawyer by profession, Usha shot to fame in 1998, when her Pickle Digest, a book with 1,000 pickle recipes, was published. Actually, I collected almost 3000 recipes but I had to pick 1000 [for the book], says Usha, who got the Pickle Queen moniker soon after. Over time, I have developed the knack of extracting recipes from anyone and everyone I come across, adds Usha, who credits her mother-in-law, Chandra Lakshmi, for lighting her passion for cooking, who at the age of 83 still actively engages herself in cooking as well as shopping for ingredients. The nuances I learnt from her but the numerous tips and tricks I gathered over a period of time, Usha says.The book has sections like Modest Pleasures (rasam from plant stems, leaves and rind-based), Hard to Resist Residual Wonder (rasam made with the residue of chutney or thogayal) and Quick Serves (instant rasam), Dynamic Diet, Heritage Sustenance, Physician at your Door, Dazzling Superstars, among others.Achieving critical massFor a perfect rasam, balancing the tamarind (sourness), adding spices and seasoning, which helps lock the flavour in, is critical. Sourness can be derived from tamarind, tomato, sour buttermilk or just dal water, says Usha, adding that rasam fits everyones budget, can be prepared with minimal ingredients, or if one or two of the basic ingredients are not available. Basic ingredients can be interchanged if one is unavailable, like moong dal can be swapped for toor dal. The dish can be prepared, tasted and changed to your desired taste all through the process of cooking. Most importantly, it is a medicinal preparation that plays a significant role throughout an individuals life from birth to old age, says Usha, adding, Which is why I have dedicated a section in the book to age-appropriate rasams, titled Birth to Adulthood.Rasam can be made out of almost anything. Have you ever tasted pea peel rasam, or betel leaf rasam? How about jamoon rasam? Did you know that we can make rasam using jackfruit seed, watermelon rind, kodukkapuli, hibiscus flower and bamboo shoot?, she asks.Even peels and plant stems, which are usually discarded, can be used. When we were in Kerala, our domestic helper used to collect banana peels and take it home. Out of curiosity, I asked her what she would do with them, and that is how I learnt to make banana peel rasam. Similarly, keera thandu, murunga keera and agathi keera lend themselves well for the dish. Rasam made with stems of mint, coriander and curry leaves will taste heavenly, says Usha.Kicking up flavoursIngredients to garnish ought to be added to ghee in a particular order. Once the ladle is hot with oil, add the urad. When it turns light brown and gives out aroma, add the mustard. As it starts to splutter, add red chillies, fenugreek seeds, cumin and curry leaves (in that order) and then pour it over the rasam. Thaalippu or garnish is the crown, so it has to be perfect, she says. If it gets burnt, just discard it and redo. In some families, they sprinkle a little water after garnishing and this is to lock the flavour.Ushas rasam podi recipe:Ingredients200 gms each of Tanjore (gundu), Salem (neetu) and Bedige chillies600 gms coriander seeds200 gms each of pepper, jeera and fenugreek1/4 of LG asafoetida bar6 to 10 turmeric sticks10 sprigs of sun-dried curry leaves2 large fistfuls toor dal1 fistful moong dal (optional)1 fistful urad dal1 fistful channa dalMethodSun-dry the ingredients and grind them to medium coarse in a mill.While assembling the dish, crushing curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves together with crystal salt and tamarind water brings out the best flavour. A slit green chilli and a blob of jaggery enhance the taste, she adds. Usha also notes that rasam is best made using an eeya chombu (a vessel made out of tin-aluminium alloy that has a broad base and narrow neck), clay pot or soapstone pot.The eeya chombu is designed in such a manner that the aroma and flavour rotate within the vessel when it is mixed with a ladle, she says, adding a word of caution, Never use cast iron to make rasam. Another important trick is assembling the rasam. You got to crush curry leaves, tomato and coriander leaves with crystal salt along with tamarind water to get that magical taste and flavour, and this comes with practice.Usha has listed wide range of rasam podi recipes in her book. Now coming to rasam podi, Usha insists that sun drying all the ingredients will result in aromatic rasam. The rule can be relaxed and ingredients roasted in a pan only during rainy days. Depending on usage, rasam podi can be stored for upto six months. Another reason why some never get it right is they might let the preparation boil over and this might ruin the flavour. When it is about to boil, switch off, garnish and close immediately. Use only ghee for garnishing as ghee acts as the vehicle for absorbing the goodness of the spices used. And the rasam connoisseur that she is, she insists she has prepared each of the 1,000 rasams in her book at least five times.The book is targeted at Indian and international audiences, and has a detailed description of all 350 ingredients with a photograph, its medicinal value, taste and usage. I have also provided tips on how to buy and store these ingredients.Adirasam delightA rasam connoisseur would always go for Adi rasam or the mandi, which is nothing but what settles at the bottom of the vessel. Once you understand the value of mandi, you will never miss it. The best way to serve rasam is to give it a good mix with a ladle and then serve it.Regional fareThe herbal concoction predominantly made in Southern states is called Rasam in Tamil Nadu. Chaaru in Andhra and Saaru in Konkan and Karnataka, the preparation usually an everyday affair is an essential part of the South Indian cusine.Seasonal RasamGita Rajamani, a food blogger whose You Tube channel, Agrahara Recipes, documents tradtional vegetarian recipes handed over from generations says that each of the spices has healing properties and is essentially facts as an immunity booster. Rasam preparation in households depends on the season, for example during the rainy season Jeera Milagu Rasam and Milagu rasam is the staple.During the Covid 19 crisis, the septuagenarian recommends Kandanthippili and Sadakuppai rasam, which is a remedy for fever, cold and cough. As it is easily digestible, rasam is suitable for people of all age groups, and for diabetic population, she recommends Goddu rasam or the mild rasam with minimal ingredients and buttermilk rasam.Nutritious Konkani SaaruFood blogger Divya Kudua, who specialises in Kerala and Konkani cuisine, says that in Kerala rasam never takes the centrestage, but is always a mild concoction made using jeera and pepper, usually served as an after meal digestive drink. In Konkani cuisine Saaru is prepared using the tamarind, dal and coconut.Usually on Fridays we make Channa water rasam, which is more like a soup and not necessarily mixed with rice and eaten. Saaru as we call it, is a nutritious dish suitable for all age groups, says Divya.Instagram@divyakuduaRaw, no fuelIn Andhra and Telangana region, there are numerous variations of Chaaru (rasam). Depending on the region, the ingredients that goes into this spiced up broth varies, says Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad.. He observes that the usage of garlic is high in these states, and more red chillies are used in the place of pepper corns. Considered a poor mans food, the dishs highlight is the garnishing, he says.His favorite is the Pacchi Pulusu, which does not require cooking and is raw. Pacchi pulusu can be prepared in a jiffy, and the most important aspect is the mixing of all the ingredients in the tamarind water with ones handsIngredients:100 grams Tamarind25 grams Green chilli00 grams Onion10 grams Curry leaves10 grams Coriander leaves10 grams Jaggery25 ml Oil10 grams Cumin seeds10 grams Dry red chilliSalt to taste500 ml WaterMethod: Soak tamarind for 30 minutes in water, squeeze and extract the pulp.

In a bowl, add water, tamarind pulp, jaggery, crushed ingredients and salt to taste. Tempering: Heat the oil, add cumin seeds, dry red chilli and curry leaves, pour the tempering over the raw tamarind rasam and mix well.Recipe by Chef Thimma Reddy, The Park, Hyderabad"

The Maharashtra state onion growers association has asked the government to prvodei them with minimum support price (MSP) for onion so that farmers will not incur losses due to the fluctuation in prices.The cost for growing onions is around Rs 950 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that range. Presently, the average wholesale onion price is around Rs 600 per quintal. It means that the farmers are incurring average losses of Rs 350 per quintal, said Bharat Dighole, president of Maharashtra state onion growers association."

The target this time is to buy 1 lakh tonnes of key kitchen staple from the major producing states, it said.""This initiative will have dual benefit of stabilising the domestic prices of onion in the COVID-19 time as well and create an all-time high buffer stocking of 1 lakh tonne which may be utilised for the lean months,"" National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) said in a statement.It has already purchased 25,000 tonnes at the prevailing rates. Onion is being purchased from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat from FPOs, cooperatives as well as direct purchase centres.Currently, the onion prices for fair average quality are ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,400 per quintal, depending on the location. The retail prices in major cities at present are ruling in the range of Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nafed said regular virtual review meetings are being held with FPOs, member cooperative societies and branches to monitor the progress of procurement, as ground challenges remain due to the deadly disease.At some places, pre-monsoon showers are affecting the pace of procurement.This season, the services of technical experts for better maintenance of the stock are also being taken in an attempt to cut into the storage losses, it said.Further, a pilot is being conducted for storage of onion after irradiation in Madhya Pradesh to evaluate the gain on account of shelf life and quality keeping.""It is hoped that this initiative of Nafed will help both the onion growers as well the consumers,"" it added.About onion storage, Nafed said the cooperative this year has added its own operational storage capacity for onions in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh by 30,000 tonne, with the support of state governments.It is in the process of creating more storage space on cluster models at farm gates in the onion growing regions since 2018, it said, adding that this initiative has enabled the Federation to enhance the procurement target, providing market support to the onion growers.Meanwhile, Nafed said it has also approached the state governments to send their requirements of lean months in advance.This will facilitate timely evacuation of the stored onion in a planned manner to have a salutary effect on the retail prices, which tend to go up in the period late August to November.Further, this will help in cutting the storage losses,as long duration of storage entails higher storage loss to the extent of 35 per cent, which gets compounded due to adverse weather conditions, as reported last year, it said.Besides onion, Nafed is procuring pulses for buffer stock."

The price of tomatoes suddenly surged to 70 a kg in some areas this week. Similarly, potatoes were also priced around 50. Onions and cabbage were among the very few reasonably priced ones.R.P. Sundari, a resident of Anna Nagar West, said even pushcart vendors were selling at different prices. Tomatoes cost anywhere between 55 to 70 a kg in our area. We avoid buying beans and broad beans as a kilogram costs above 60. For two people, we spend 250 on a quarter kg of four-five vegetables every two or three days, she said.With meat and fish shops closed during the lockdown, people who consume non-vegetarian food have shifted to a vegetarian diet. This has also led to a spurt in demand and price hike, traders said. Divya Prasanth, of Mogappair, said, Vegetables are expensive now. But I am saving money as meat and fish prices sky-rocketed since the start of the lockdown.Wholesale traders in Thirumazhisai market said fewer arrivals were one of the main reasons that pushed up the prices by 10-20% this week. Moreover, distance of travel for retailers and rise in transportation charges, because of the hiked fuel cost, have also added to the surge. Tomatoes sold for 20 a kg now cost 30 at the wholesale market. Potatoes were now priced 27 a kg. Capsicum and green chillies have jumped to 60 and 40 a kg respectively.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders Associations of KWMC Periyar Market, said retailers travelled an additional distance of minimum 30 km to Thirumazhisai and the wait was six to seven hours longer.Semi-retailers in Koyambedu market have not been allotted shops yet. This has led to a missing link. Retailers, who otherwise bought required quantity, have to buy in bulk and bear the cost of wastage. This is why the wholesale variations do not often reflect in retail prices. For instance, wholesale price of beans and broad beans dropped to 30 and 15 on Tuesday, he added.The wholesale prices were expected to soar as farmers may cultivate less after repeated losses over the past few months, traders added."

Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week."

A lot of love and hard work goes into the preparation of all the dishes that are cooked for the feast and practically no expense is spared in the celebration of this festival. Since mutton is the main attraction of this special occasion, the fragrant aroma of biryani is the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of a feast.ALSO READ: Eid al-Adah 2020: History and significance of Bakrid, and date of celebration in IndiaHere are some traditional and some unconventional recipes that you can try on this Bakrid, even as we continue to safely social distance at home amid the pandemic:MUTTON DUM BIRYANIIngredients 8 Onions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup Ginger, chopped 1/4 cup Garlic, cloves 7 Green ChilliesFor the rice 1 Bay leaves (tej patta), torn 2 Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds 1-inch Cinnamon stick 3 Cloves (Laung) 2 cups Basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes Salt, to tasteIngredients to marinate 500 grams Mutton, curry cut 1 cup Hung Curd (Greek Yogurt) 1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder 1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi) 1 teaspoon Garam masala powder Salt, to tasteOther Ingredients 2 Bay leaves (tej patta) 2-inch Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini) 4 Cloves (Laung) 1 Mace (Javitri) 4 Dagad phool (/pathar phool/black stone flower) 1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder 1/4 teaspoon Garam masala powder 2 Tomatoes, finely chopped 1/2 cup Mint Leaves (Pudina), chopped Salt, to taste 1/2 cup Milk Saffron strands 4 tablespoons Sunflower Oil 4 Ghee 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour, for sealing the vesselInstructions To begin making the Mutton Dum Biryani Recipe, first we will make a paste of the ginger, garlic and green chillies. Into a mixer grinder add the chopped ginger, garlic cloves and green chillies. Blend to make a paste and keep aside. Wash mutton thoroughly. Add the washed mutton into a mixing bowl and add the yogurt, 1 tablespoon of the ginger garlic and chilli paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala and salt to taste. Cover and place the mutton in the refrigerator and marinate it for at least 4 hours. Into a preheated pan add oil and the sliced onions. Saut the onions on low to medium heat until caramelized. This process takes time so be patient so as to get the perfect golden-brown caramelized onions. If you brown the onions on high heat, then the onions will not caramelize evenly. Once done, keep 1/2 the portion of the caramelized onions for the biryani masala and 1/2 portion for garnishing the Mutton Dum Biryani. The next step is to cook the rice until it is 3/4th done. Into a saucepan add 4 cups of water, the bay leaf, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, salt to taste and the washed basmati rice. Allow the rice to boil in the water for 3 to 4 minutes. Power cook the rice until 3/4th done. Once done drain the water from the rice, add a tablespoon of ghee to the rice and mix gently. Cover & keep aside. Next, make the saffron milk; dissolve the saffron strands in warm milk and keep aside. Next is to make the dough to seal the bowl for dum cooking. Into a bowl add the wheat flour and add water to make a firm dough. Cover and keep aside.Method Into a large biryani pan add 2 tablespoons of ghee. Once the ghee is hot, add bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cloves, mace, pathar ka phool and saut for a few seconds until the aromas come through. Once done add the rest of the ginger garlic and chilli paste and saut for a minute. Now add the red chilli powder, garam masala and saut it in the onion garlic paste until the raw smell goes away. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt to taste and saut until the tomatoes become soft and mushy. Once the tomatoes are soft add the caramelized onions and stir well to combine. Add the marinated mutton, the chopped mint leaves and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of water and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and simmer and cook mutton for 40 minutes until the mutton is cooked and the gravy becomes thick. Once done add the 3/4th cooked rice on top of the mutton gravy. Spread the rice evenly over the gravy. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice and add some caramelized onions. Keep a tablespoon of caramelized onions aside for final garnish. Finally, a small bunch of chopped mint leaves. Turn the heat to low. Cover the pan and seal the lid with the atta dough. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes and turn off the heat. Allow the Mutton Dum Biryani to rest for 10 minutes before opening the pot. Cut the atta dough and remove the dough. Open the pot and mix the Mutton Dum Biryani gently and transfer into a serving bowl. Garnish with the remaining caramelized onions and serve.-- Recipe by Archanas KitchenVEGAN BIRYANIIngredients 1 cup basmati rice 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1/4 cup chopped pistachios 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, divided 2 teaspoons coriander seeds 1 star anise 8 cardamom pods 1 cinnamon stick 1 3/4 cup water 1 teaspoon salt, divided 1 onion, chopped 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup golden raisins 1 cup chopped fresh green beans 2 cups chopped cauliflower florets 1 yukon gold potato, small chop 1 cup frozen peas 1 carrot, small chop 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juiceInstructions Rinse the rice in a bowl or sieve.

45,45,2020-07-30,Kurnool onion farmers suffer as market shut due to pandemic,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2020/jul/30/kurnool-onion-farmers-suffer-as-market-shut-2176759.html,"K Madhu Sudhakar ByExpress News ServiceKURNOOL: Onion farmers in Kurnool had been expecting bumper returns like in the last season, but their hopes have come crashing down, as markets in the district are shut due to the pandemic. Several farmers have left their crop in the fields, as they are not confident of recovering the costs they would incur in harvesting and transporting the produce to faraway markets.The Kurnool market yard was shut after some traders there tested positive for coronavirus. Shifting the onions to far-off urban markets would be a waste as the traders there are not offering good prices, said Hanumantha Reddy, a farmer from Yerrakota village in Yammiganur Assembly constituency, adding that he has crop on three acres that he doesnt plan to harvest.If we take the produce to the market for direct sale, the traders only offer between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, depending on the quality, which is not remunerative for us, he said.Farmers usually grow onion in May, but this time, they cultivated it on at least 5,000 acres in April itself as there was no other work due to the lockdown, and they were lured by last years good prices.At least 95 per cent of my crop has been harvested and prepared for transport. Most of the rest has also been harvested, said J Ashok Kumar, of Gokulapadu village in the district, who took two acres of land on lease to cultivate onion.Kumar said the crop will get spoiled if it is not harvested or taken to the market yard at the right time, and added that he spent about Rs 35,000 per acre so far on leasing the land, buying onion saplings, transplantation, fertilisers and engaging farm hands to remove weeds. Besides this, he would have to spend about Rs 13,000 for harvesting, trimming, transporting, loading and unloading, and other expenses.I have decided to leave the crop on the field as spending Rs 13,000 more would not be beneficial. Only if I get at least Rs 2,000 per quintal like last year will I be able to afford to try to sell the crop. But the situation now is different, he rued.Adding to the worries of the farmers, the recent rains damaged onion crop on at least 2,500 acres, including the recently-cultivated crop for the Kharif season in the district. Kurnool agriculture market yard secretary R Jaya Lakshmi said they closed market yard 10 days ago.Some of our staff and traders contracted Covid-19 recently, she explained, and added that they plan to hold discussions with traders on resuming work. A meeting is likely to be held on Thursday. Horticulture department assistant director B Raghunath Reddy said onions were cultivated on nearly 5,000 acres.But farmers have been facing problems in transportation and finding markets to sell the produce, he added. The only possibility is for them to sell the onions at the Tadepalligudem market for Rs 500-700 per quintal, but market is open only three days a week, he said. However, it is tough to transport the crop from Kurnool amid the pandemic, and with the low rates, the farmers would suffer losses, he added."

Add 2 tbsp besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and  tsp turmeric powder.Mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.Then add water. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. I added 1 cup water. Depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from  to 1 cup water.With the spatula or spoon, first mix. Break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.Then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. This adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.The batter should have a flowing consistency. Cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. I kept for 15 hours. If you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours.This is how the batter looks the next day. You will see small bubbles on the top.Stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.So to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.With a spoon mix very well.Now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. You can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. You can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. Depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.Preparing sugar syrupTake 1 cup sugar in a pan. Add 1/4 tsp saffron strands to it. Do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebis.Add 1/2 cup water.Keep this pan on stove top on low flame and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.On a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.Cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the flame and add 1/4 tsp lime or lemon juice. Stir well. Keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebis in it.Frying jalebiHeat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. You can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. Ghee gives a better flavour.To check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. If it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebis to be fried. The frying temperature is 350 degrees fahrenheit/176 degrees celsius.Now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.Either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. Be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.You wont get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. This does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make them.When one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.Some jalebis will be cooked faster than others.Fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. Remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. While removing shake to drain the extra oil.Adding fried jalebi to sugar syrupThen immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. The sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.Turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.Keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. If you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes, they will have a deep color.Remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. Shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. Place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.Make all jalebi this way. Its better to have a help while doing so. Otherwise it is kind of multi-tasking.Serve jalebi hot, warm or at room temperature. The leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.Recipe courtesy: vegrecipesofindia.com* Hersheys Shahi Kalakand PhirniPreparation Time: 5 minsCooking Time: 45 minsServes: 4Ingredients650 ml of milk 40gms soaked rice, crushed 250 ml HERSHEYS Chocolate Flavoured Syrup1 tsp Cardamom powder2 tsp pistachios sliced (blanched & skinned)100 g KalakandMethodHeat milk on low flame in a heavy bottom broad pan & heat till it reduces to half, keep stirring at intervals so that the lumps are not formedAs the milk reduces, pour in the rice paste and stir continuously.

The Central Railway on Sunday announced that frequency of Kisan Rail will be increased from weekly to bi-weekly.Said CR general manager Sanjeev Mittal : ""The Kisan Rail flagged off recently, is changing the lives of farmers in the state with assurance of better price with faster and cheaper transportation, providing seamless supply chain, preventing the destruction of perishable farm produce -- thereby increasing income.""On its third trip on August 21, Kisan Rail from Devlali to Muzaffarpur carried 235 tonnes of goods from Maharashtra which included agro produce consisting of Pomegranate, Lemon, Cauliflower, fish, Mixed vegetables, chillies, Capsicum , ginger, Onions, garlic & eggs.""Having loaded the farm produce at Belvandi station of Solapur Division for the first time, the farmer groups were elated and offered thanks to Railway ministry for running this special train to transport perishable goods to different parts of the country,"" said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. ""Prior to Kisan Rail, they were depending on road transport. Further, the farmers group is hopeful that this new facility will definitely encourage many farmers to bring more produce like vegetables, grapes and other items to be transported from now on,"" he stated.Kisan Rail was announced in the Union Budget 2020-21 to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish.""This Kisan Rail catering to the requirements of small farmers and small traders will prove to be not only a game changer,"" said Sutar, adding, ""Central Railway through its Business Development Unit is aggressively marketing with local farmers, loaders, APMC and individuals and aggregating their demands.

The bulb is set to become a prized possession with the monsoon playing spoilsport traders say the price of this kitchen essential is due to go sharp north in the days ahead, while the quality will nosedive.They blame the monsoon, flooding and poor inter-state coordination for this. Onion traders say that a kilo of onion, which cost Rs 10, almost doubled during the festive period, after the lockdown was eased and markets were opened. But now the price is likely to shoot up further.At present, 1kg of onion costs Rs 20-30, depending on the size, and is likely to escalate to Rs 40-50; in some places, a superior grade of the bulb costs Rs 50, and could go up to Rs 80. During the festival season, though cost was rising, we didnt escalate the price too much as we feared we would lose whatever little business we were getting after the lockdown was lifted.But now we will be forced to sell at a high price if there is poor supply, said a trader. C Udayshankar, secretary of the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Yeshwantpur, said that most of the retailers did not hike prices during the festival, but now costs are set to rise. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Maharashtra has damaged standing crops.So far, the onion coming from Maharashtra is old stock, and will not last long. The new stock will be moist and have more water content, making them difficult to store for long, he said. Last year too, consumers, farmers and traders had faced a similar situation, where onion quality had dipped and cost was high. Apart from Maharashtra, heavy rain and flooding in North Karnataka will also lead to a price escalation. The picture will be clear after a fortnight, when new stock starts coming in.

And this decision has made people think of resuming their exercise regime and getting back into shape. While exercise is the most important to stay fit, a well-balanced diet also plays a very crucial role. For as they say, we are what we eat.Although wed all love to lose weight while not compromising on what we eat, such isnt the case. However, a few simple lifestyle changes and alterations in food habits can work wonders for us, say experts.Nuts is something nutritionist Tripti Tandon swears by: Almonds have the ability to cut down cravings, and also help in weight loss. Yogurt is also a very good superfood. You can add oatmeal, granola or fruits and make it a healthy bowl. You can even add berries, which are rich in antioxidants, as well as nuts, making for a healthy meal. Legumes such as black and red rajma, kala chana, soyabeans are excellent sources of protein, fibre and iron. You can make a chaat out of kala chana or rajma, as it also helps boost immunity.Nuts are a nutritional way to settle those hunger pangs ( Photo: Shutterstock )Have lots of green leafy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, etc), as they are rich in vitamins and calcium. Also, olive oil can be used, as it is rich in good fatty acids. Whole grains are also very good, as they are rich in vitamins and minerals, and lower cholesterol in the body. Onions, tomatoes and garlic are also superfoods, she says.However, Tandon cautions that no matter how healthy, anything in excess is not good. Insisting on portion control, she also suggests wrapping up dinner early. If you are hungry later, you could have a fruit, some nuts, any herbal tea or a small cup of milk with cocoa, she adds.A key factor for weight gain during the lockdown, according to Ritika Samaddar, a senior dietitian, is binge eating and excessive snacking. We must get back into a disciplined life. During the lockdown, people were getting up late, skipping breakfast, opting for a heavy brunch, etc. Since everyone was at home, people were cooking all sorts of dishes. Therefore, it is important to keep a check on snacking. Opt for healthier options like walnuts, sprouts or a bowl of fruits. Carry a smoothie, as you need a good amount of probiotic. Also, when youre moving out of home, hydration becomes key. Carry detox water, chaach or fresh lime. Also, carry home-cooked food, as when you eat out, you consume unhealthy calories, she adds.Theres nothing quite like a healthy smoothie bowl, to satiate our taste buds ( HT Photo )Samaddar also asserts that people should have breakfast within two hours of waking up. The food that you have for breakfast is also important. It has to be a combination of carbohydrates with proteins. You could start your day with some lukewarm water with honey. You could also opt for ginger water, lemon water, or kadha, she adds.READ: Feeling sluggish? You might be dehydrated!However, in addition to controlling our diet, it is also important to practise mindful eating, says Preeti Rao, a health and wellness expert. Become an intuitive eater. Most people are not connected with their hunger. For example, a baby eats only when it is hungry, and only as much as it needs, with no indulgence. As we grow up, we become less intuitive of our hunger and land up eating just for taste or managing our emotions. Make sure you activate all the sensory organs when you eat. In other words, watch you food, taste your food, smell your food and observe how the food makes you feel in your body. This can happen only if we eat in peace and not with our televisions on or while looking into our phones, she opines.Rao also recommends opting for seasonal produce. Every season brings with it various fruits and vegetables. With increased genetically modified foods, we now have access to our favourite fruits or vegetables all through the seasons. Seasonal fruits and vegetables have properties that suit the climate we are in. For example, summer fruits have more water, which cools the body down. Be educated about the produce you are eating, she suggests.Author tweets @srinidhi_gkFor more stories follow Facebook and Twitter"
