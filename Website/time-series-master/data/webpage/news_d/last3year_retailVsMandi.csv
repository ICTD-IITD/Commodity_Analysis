0,0,2020-02-07,Why onions are making you cry despite enough supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-onions-are-making-you-cry-despite-enough-supply/articleshow/74016807.cms,"An onion market in Delhi. (File photo)NEW DELHI/NASHIK: Are onions still wreaking havoc on your monthly budget? For once, supply issues are not to blame, with around 50 trucks of onions coming in from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Azadpur Mandi every day, each bringing in around 20 tonnes of the essential commodity.The reason why they continue to cost you a bomb then is the high retail and wholesale price differential in Delhi. While the wholesale price currently ranges between Rs 15/kg and Rs 25/kg, retailers are selling onions for anywhere between Rs 40/kg and Rs 60/kg. Usually, sellers keep a margin of Rs 15/kg to account for transportation, storage and other costs. A 100% margin, which even some traders find hard to explain, is biting consumers hard.In Nashik, which is Delhis biggest supplier, the average wholesale price has steadily dropped over the last few weeks. To put things in perspective, it was Rs 1,600/quintal on Friday, a drop of 40% from Rs 2,600/quintal on January 31. The average wholesale price had touched an all-time high of Rs 8,625/quintal on December 16 last year at Lasalgaon APMC, the countrys largest wholesale onion market. Since then, the prices has dropped almost 81%.In the past fortnight, the drop is nearly 64%  from Rs 4,100/quintal on January 20.This decline, however, is yet to reflect in the retail markets of Delhi. In terms of kilograms, when the wholesale price ranged between Rs 60 and Rs 100 from mid-December to mid-January, individual consumers were buying it for anywhere between Rs 80/kg and Rs 120/kg. On Friday, at the roadside stalls near Mata Sundri College in New Delhi, onions were being sold at Rs 50/kg. Similarly, in east Delhis Samaspur, the retail price was between Rs 55/kg and Rs 60/kg. Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller in Samaspur F Block, said the prices had come down by Rs 30-40/kg in a month. Its gradually going down, he claimed.In south Delhis Vasant Kunj, too, the current retail price hovered around Rs 50/kg.Rajan Pal, a seller at Bhogal vegetable market, said at Rs 55, the commodity was far cheaper than it was a couple of months ago when a kilogram cost above Rs 100. . We get onions from Afghanistan and other countries too, but people prefer the Indian version, he said.Srikant Mishra, secretary of Onion Traders Association, Azadpur Mandi, found the high wholesale-retail price differential surprising. There is no shortage of supply in the wholesale market. But the retail prices are much higher than usual, he said, adding that the retail prices were decided by the retailers. The economics of demand and supply determines the prices in the retail markets and there is no mechanism to control them. Factors like location and quality of the product play their part too: in upscale colonies, the retail prices are typically higher.Pintu Mandal, a seller at a market in Govindpuri, said onions were going as high as Rs 60/kg as the wholesale price was still steep. He attributed this to many wholesalers hoarding stocks with an eye on a dip in supply later.According to Lasalgaon APMC officials, there has been a rise in production in all onion-growing pockets of the country in the last one month, but the demand has remained in the same territory as earlier. This has led to a drop in the average wholesale price. Production is good in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu too. This has led to a drop in demand for Maharashtras onions. As a result, the average wholesale onion price has dropped, Suvarna Jagtap, chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC, said. She said a continuous fluctuations in the wholesale price were also responsible for the selling price not stabilising. The Centre had yet to lift the stock limit on wholesale and onion traders, which had been cut from 50 tonnes to 25 tonnes for wholesalers and from 10 tonnes to 5 tonnes for retailers, Jagtap said.The government needs to lift the restrictions on onion traders  both wholesalers and retailers, she added.A source in the Union ministry of agriculture, however, denied that there was any control over retail prices. Some retailers have already purchased onions from the wholesale market and are releasing these gradually. This is the reason for the wide gap. The retail prices will drop gradually, he said."

Order NowNEW DELHI: Daily labourers and migrant workers living in and around Nizamuddin in the national capital complained of overpriced essentials and vegetables as the police beefed up security in the area after it emerged the biggest hotspot for the spread of coronavirus in India.Onion is retailing at Rs 60/kg, tomato at Rs 50/kg, potato at Rs 40/kg, while other seasonal vegetables are selling at not less than Rs 100-120/kg in the Sarai Kale Khan area, less than 5 km from Nizamuddin West Even dry ration supplies are being sold at higher price. For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi . Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.""Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,"" Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearly Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: ""I don't have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.""Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, ""Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.""Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat 's headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works."
3,3,2020-05-18,Vegetables rot at Thirumazhisai as traders have no storage space,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vegetables-rot-at-thirumazhisai-as-traders-have-no-storage-space/article31618297.ece,"The wholesale traders at Thirumazhisai market, which was opened a week ago and has since been getting a steady supply, are losing 15% of vegetables as wastage for want of storage space.The wholesale vegetable market was shifted from Koyambedu to the temporary facility at Thirumazhisai on May 10.Wholesale traders said steps taken against the spread of COVID-19 has led to another problem. Unable to put up with the long waiting time to enter the market, many small retailers had stopped going Thirumazhisai for purchase. This is forcing wholesale traders to sell the produce at throwaway prices. On an average, the market gets about 4,000 tonnes of vegetables daily. About 500 tonnes goes waste as there is no space to store them.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of Koyambedu Market Wholesale Merchants Association, said this had affected farmers who were bringing produce to the market. For instance, vegetables such as brinjal and ladies finger were sold 5 a kg as there were no takers at the end of stipulated business hours. Even carrots were sold 7 a kg.Farmers suffered a loss because such vegetables must be sold for a minimum of 10 a kg for them to cover labour charges and transportation. These benefits never reach the customers in the city as many retailers dont reduce the price, he said.Onions and potatoes can be stocked better than green vegetables. Moreover, only a section of shops get more business and those at the rear tend to dump vegetables for want of takers. The authorities concerned must help distribute the vehicles entering the market to all shops to prevent wastage, the traders said. They suggested that the government could adopt similar measures with stringent norms and reopen Koyambedu market soon."
4,4,2020-05-24,Wholesale veggie prices crash during lockdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wholesale-veggie-prices-crash-during-lockdown/articleshow/75927840.cms,"In the two months since the country went into lockdown, vegetable prices have crashed in wholesale markets across states. The only exception is the potato, which at just under Rs 20 a kg on average, is almost double what it sold for in May last year.TOI looked at wholesale prices of the 15 most common veggies across 19 states and found that prices of all of them, barring potatoes and lemons, had fallen in almost all the states. To discount for seasonal variations, TOI also compared prices with last May, and found the fall to be even sharper (even lemons were way more expensive in May 2019).With state borders sealed, and supply chains hampered, what possibly led to the crashing prices was distress sale of perishable veggies and a sharp drop in demand.""Disruption of supply chain during the lockdown is among the major reason of this collapse in prices,"" said Ashok Gulati, chair professor for agriculture at ICRIER, a policy think-tank. ""If we take onions, the lockdown coincided with the rabi harvest season. That crop could not be transported at that time and is now reaching the market. This has led to the crash in prices,"" he added.Raj Kumar Bhatia, general secretary of the Chamber of Azadpur Fruit & Vegetable Traders (Delhi's biggest mandi), said, ""Our supplies were largely intact but some northern states like Punjab and Himachal Pradesh enforced a strict lockdown. Azadpur mandi is their biggest supplier. And our vehicles could not cross over. So, there were incidents of distress sale.""Bhatia added that the situation could have been better had there been clearer guidelines for local vendors who procure from Azadpur Mandi and supply to Delhi's local markets.Officials from APMCs (Agriculture Produce Market Committees) in the southern states, however, said their supply chains were not disrupted and the crash was probably because of a sudden drop in demand from bulk buyers like restaurants and hotels.Also, the fact that several events like wedding feasts were put off led to a lower demand. The steep fall in wholesale prices, however, hasn't translated into a proportional fall in retail prices, which vary significantly across markets and outlets.So, farmers' income has fallen while consumers haven't benefited fully. It's the middlemen who have raised their margin.The average wholesale price of bhindi, or ladies' finger, (calculated by the government's Agmarknet portal that tracks agricultural marketing) was Rs 3.9 per kg in Chhattisgarh, down 84.6% from March 2020 and 57.3% lower than last May. While Chhattisgarh saw the sharpest drop, prices fell the least in Kerala and Karnataka.Prices of karela (bitter gourd), too, fell in all states, the sharpest - 60% - in Punjab and Haryana. It was the same story for bottle gourd, whose prices crashed everywhere except Kerala and Karnataka.The pricey capsicum was also humbled, selling at Rs 4.4 a kg in Punjab, down over 77%.Garlic prices have also fallen in all states; so have green chillies, which went into a free fall in most states. Onion prices have fallen in all states while tomato is also being sold at lower prices in most of the major states.Prices of brinjal, cabbage, ginger, cucumber and cauliflower showed mixed trends - falling in some states while rising in others."
5,5,2020-05-28,"Ahmedabad: Onion, green chilli prices plunge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/onion-green-chilli-prices-plunge-amid-low-demand-from-hotels/articleshow/76049152.cms,"Photo for representative purpose onlyAHMEDABAD: With a bumper crop and decline in bulk demand from restaurants and eateries, wholesale prices of onions and green chillies have come crashing down. In the Ahmedabad Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), the wholesale price of onions declined from Rs 40 a kg ahead of the lockdown to Rs 12 a kilogram on Wednesday. APMC officials attribute the decline to decline in demand, coupled with unsold inventory and even a bumper harvest of the crop.Onion prices declined 50% against last year as consumption took a hit. About 20% of the stock of onions which arrives at the APMC is left unsold and as a result, the traders have started ordering less quantity of onions, said a source at the APMC.Similar is the case with green chillies, capsicums and tomatoes. The demand for green chillies dropped by 30% and consequently, the prices too declined to settle in the range of Rs 12-30 per kg, said a wholesale trader.Traders have attributed the decline in price to the dropping of wholesale consumption at hotels, restaurants and eateries. The hotel industry is completely closed due to the lockdown and despite relaxations by allowing takeaway orders, the business hasnt resumed as much due to which the demand is very low. Moreover, this year, the production of onion has gone up by 10% against last year. Both these factors have contributed to the decline in prices, said a trader.When contacted, sources in the hotels and restaurants industry said that barely 20% of the restaurants have been able to resume operations through takeaway models and the order volumes too have drastically declined. As a result, the consumption of vegetables is bound to go down.Officials at APMC Ahmedabad said that on Wednesday, barely 537 quintal of onions were traded against 1,800 quintals traded usually. The dealers had enough stock of onions to meet the days demand and thus, only 336 quintals from Maharashtra and 201 quintals from Mahuva was procured, said a senior official."

The All-India CPI-IW for May 2020 increased by 1 point and stood at 330.On 1-month percentage change, it increased by 0.30 per cent between April and May, 2020 compared to 0.64 per cent increase between the same months of the previous year. The maximum upward pressure in current index came from Food group contributing 0.67 percentage points rise to the total change.At commodity level, Arhar Dal, Masur Dal, Moong Dal, Urd Dal, Groundnut Oil, Mustard Oil, Fish Fresh, Goat Meat, Poultry (Chicken), Milk, Cabbage, French Bean, Green Coriander Leaves, Potato, Country Liquor, Refined Liquor, Cooking Gas, Petrol, etc. are responsible for the increase in index, the data showed.However, this increase was checked by Rice, Wheat, Garlic, Onion, Bitter Gourd, Coconut, Gourd, Lady Finger, Mango, Parval, Tomato, Torai, Banana, Kerosene Oil, etc, putting downward pressure on the index, it stated.At centre level, Warangal, Chhindwara and Ahmedabad recorded the maximum increase of 6 points each.Among others, 4 points increase was observed in 6 centres, 3 points in 11 centres, 2 points in 9 centres and 1 point in 8 centres.On the contrary, Doom-Dooma Tinsukia recorded the maximum decrease of 10 points followed by Salem (9 points), Munger-Jamalpur (8 points) and Lucknow (7 points).Among others, 5 points decrease was observed in 1 centre, 4 points in another 1 centre, 3 points in 6 centres, 2 points in 9 centres and 1 point in another 9 centres.

Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said ,""The fall in inflation during the month in general and food in particular due to free supply of cereals to households across the country under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) during lockdown had put less burden on the pockets of 130 crore people in the country.""Lauding the efforts of the Labour Bureau, he said, ""Our labour bureau is doing a great job by bringing out the inflation data during these challenging times under lockdown. This will help policy makers."" The hike in dearness allowance and dearness relief for over one crore central government employees and pensioners is worked out on the basis of CPI-IW."
8,8,2020-07-01,"Rising fuel cost, supply shortage send vegetable prices soaring",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rising-fuel-cost-supply-shortage-send-vegetable-prices-soaring/article31958458.ece,"Disruptions in supply chain and a continuous rise in fuel prices have sent retail vegetables prices soaring in the city.Residents of various suburbs noted that most vegetables were priced at a minimum of 40-50 per kg in retail stores. The price of tomatoes suddenly surged to 70 a kg in some areas this week. Similarly, potatoes were also priced around 50. Onions and cabbage were among the very few reasonably priced ones.R.P. Sundari, a resident of Anna Nagar West, said even pushcart vendors were selling at different prices. Tomatoes cost anywhere between 55 to 70 a kg in our area. We avoid buying beans and broad beans as a kilogram costs above 60. For two people, we spend 250 on a quarter kg of four-five vegetables every two or three days, she said.With meat and fish shops closed during the lockdown, people who consume non-vegetarian food have shifted to a vegetarian diet. This has also led to a spurt in demand and price hike, traders said. Divya Prasanth, of Mogappair, said, Vegetables are expensive now. But I am saving money as meat and fish prices sky-rocketed since the start of the lockdown.Wholesale traders in Thirumazhisai market said fewer arrivals were one of the main reasons that pushed up the prices by 10-20% this week. Moreover, distance of travel for retailers and rise in transportation charges, because of the hiked fuel cost, have also added to the surge. Tomatoes sold for 20 a kg now cost 30 at the wholesale market. Potatoes were now priced 27 a kg. Capsicum and green chillies have jumped to 60 and 40 a kg respectively.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders Associations of KWMC Periyar Market, said retailers travelled an additional distance of minimum 30 km to Thirumazhisai and the wait was six to seven hours longer.Semi-retailers in Koyambedu market have not been allotted shops yet. This has led to a missing link. Retailers, who otherwise bought required quantity, have to buy in bulk and bear the cost of wastage. This is why the wholesale variations do not often reflect in retail prices. For instance, wholesale price of beans and broad beans dropped to 30 and 15 on Tuesday, he added.The wholesale prices were expected to soar as farmers may cultivate less after repeated losses over the past few months, traders added."

Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said.
