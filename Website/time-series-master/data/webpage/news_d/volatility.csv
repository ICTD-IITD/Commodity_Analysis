1,1,2020-05-27,Haryana farmers in dismay over deep plunge in onion prices,https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-in-dismay-over-deep-plunge-in-onion-prices/story-ymbxiaoGVobiq5jT5Mp8nI.html,"chandigarhUpdated: May 28, 2020 01:25 ISTOnion farmers across the state are in dismay as wholesale prices have crashed drastically and they are unable to cover the input cost amid the lack of buyers.Onion had dominated the headlines in October last year due to its skyrocketing prices, as it was sold for 100 per kg. But now, farmers are being forced to sell it for 7- 9 per kg in the absence of buyers. This has made them question the system of marketing vegetables in the country.The traders and farmers blame the Covid-19 lockdown for the fall in rates. The farmers revealed that big transporters and buyers were not showing interest in onion due to which they were unable to sell their entire produce in the local markets.In the absence of big traders due to the lockdown, we have been selling the crop to local merchants and street vendors. This is the reason why the prices have crashed to around 8 per kg from 14 per kg last year, said Raj Kumar, a trader from Pipli onion market in Kurukshetra.As per the traders, the Pipli mandi is the biggest onion market in the northern districts of Haryana and most farmers, even from Punjab, come here to sell their produce in hope of better prices. As there is no mechanism to store the produce, the farmers have no choice but to sell it even if at lower prices, said another trader Praveen Kumar, adding that there is no possibility of rise in the prices as the harvesting is in its last leg and most of the produce has already been purchased.However, the fall in prices has appalled the farmers.I sowed onion on two acres of land and yielded nearly 110 quintals per acre, hoping for handsome returns. But it was unable to fetch me even the input cost which is around 50,000 per acre, rued farmer Raj Kumar from Fatehgarh village of Yamunanagar district.Farmers also claimed that they had to purchase nurseries at higher prices this year.This year, the production cost has doubled as the farmers had to purchase onion nurseries at higher prices. Also, there has been also a dip of about 10-20 quintals in per acre yield due to untimely rainfall. Farmers have not been able to earn much so far this year, said Vijay Kumar, a farmer from of Kurukshetras Kaserla village.As per state horticulture department officials, due to the increase in the onion prices last year, the onion acreage has increased to over 36,000 hectares from 32,000 hectares and its production to around 8.77 lakh MT against the 7.80 lakh MT from last year."
2,2,2020-07-01,"Rising fuel cost, supply shortage send vegetable prices soaring",https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rising-fuel-cost-supply-shortage-send-vegetable-prices-soaring/article31958458.ece,"Disruptions in supply chain and a continuous rise in fuel prices have sent retail vegetables prices soaring in the city.Residents of various suburbs noted that most vegetables were priced at a minimum of 40-50 per kg in retail stores. The price of tomatoes suddenly surged to 70 a kg in some areas this week. Similarly, potatoes were also priced around 50. Onions and cabbage were among the very few reasonably priced ones.R.P. Sundari, a resident of Anna Nagar West, said even pushcart vendors were selling at different prices. Tomatoes cost anywhere between 55 to 70 a kg in our area. We avoid buying beans and broad beans as a kilogram costs above 60. For two people, we spend 250 on a quarter kg of four-five vegetables every two or three days, she said.With meat and fish shops closed during the lockdown, people who consume non-vegetarian food have shifted to a vegetarian diet. This has also led to a spurt in demand and price hike, traders said. Divya Prasanth, of Mogappair, said, Vegetables are expensive now. But I am saving money as meat and fish prices sky-rocketed since the start of the lockdown.Wholesale traders in Thirumazhisai market said fewer arrivals were one of the main reasons that pushed up the prices by 10-20% this week. Moreover, distance of travel for retailers and rise in transportation charges, because of the hiked fuel cost, have also added to the surge. Tomatoes sold for 20 a kg now cost 30 at the wholesale market. Potatoes were now priced 27 a kg. Capsicum and green chillies have jumped to 60 and 40 a kg respectively.D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders Associations of KWMC Periyar Market, said retailers travelled an additional distance of minimum 30 km to Thirumazhisai and the wait was six to seven hours longer.Semi-retailers in Koyambedu market have not been allotted shops yet. This has led to a missing link. Retailers, who otherwise bought required quantity, have to buy in bulk and bear the cost of wastage. This is why the wholesale variations do not often reflect in retail prices. For instance, wholesale price of beans and broad beans dropped to 30 and 15 on Tuesday, he added.The wholesale prices were expected to soar as farmers may cultivate less after repeated losses over the past few months, traders added."
3,3,2020-07-22,"Rain, lockdown push vegetable prices up",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-lockdown-push-vegetable-prices-up/story-GAcS0nZ8UfoUFbIM6HFqfN.html,"indiaUpdated: Jul 23, 2020 03:51 ISTPrices of commonly consumed vegetables, such as potatoes and tomatoes, have risen sharply across the country, with major wholesale markets running low on supplies due to disruptions caused heavy rains and lockdowns, apart from lower output of some items and higher fuel costs.On Tuesday, the average all-India retail price of potatoes stood at Rs 35 a kg, while tomatoes were selling for an average of Rs 55 a kg, up from Rs 20 and Rs 30 on July 1, data from the consumer affairs ministry showed.Rains and partial or complete lockdown in cities such as Bangalore, Pune, Guwahati and Bhopal to contain the spread of Covid-19, have upended supply chains, causing prices of commonly consumed vegetables to spike manifold. Among kitchen staples, households are paying the highest for potatoes and tomatoes. Onion prices are stable or have fallen in some markets due to higher production last winter, officials in wholesale markets said.A combination of factors is behind the rising prices, traders said. Farmers in many states dumped perishables during the lockdown, unable to find buyers. So, tomatoes are in short supply. Transportation costs have risen 5-10% because of fuel price hikes by the government, Maruti Mallale, the proprietor of Mahesh Vegetable Company at Maharashtras Vashi said.At Delhis Azadpur wholesale market, during July 13-19, the average wholesale price of potatoes rose 53.5% from a year ago, the sharpest rise in four years, data from the consumer affairs ministrys Agmarknet tracker showed. During the same period, potato quantity brought for trade dropped 42% in the market. Azadpur is the national capitals biggest hub for vegetable trade and sets benchmark retail prices across the national capital region. During the same period, tomato prices at the Azadpur market rose 33.9% from a year ago, while its arrival fell 37%.Supply of most of the vegetables has been affected. Arrivals in cold storage have been 30% less, said Anil Chaudhury, an official of Agra Cold Storage Association. This suggests that farmers have grown less potato during 2019-20, he said. Onion prices, on the other hand, have declined. Average prices of onions in the Azadpur market fell 20.9% in the July 13-19 week."
4,4,2020-08-25,"Onion to become kitchen king again, price set to go north",https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2020/aug/25/onion-to-become-kitchen-king-again-price-set-to-go-north-2187916.html,"Bosky Khanna ByExpress News ServiceBENGALURU: Time to stock up on onions. The bulb is set to become a prized possession with the monsoon playing spoilsport traders say the price of this kitchen essential is due to go sharp north in the days ahead, while the quality will nosedive.They blame the monsoon, flooding and poor inter-state coordination for this. Onion traders say that a kilo of onion, which cost Rs 10, almost doubled during the festive period, after the lockdown was eased and markets were opened. But now the price is likely to shoot up further.At present, 1kg of onion costs Rs 20-30, depending on the size, and is likely to escalate to Rs 40-50; in some places, a superior grade of the bulb costs Rs 50, and could go up to Rs 80. During the festival season, though cost was rising, we didnt escalate the price too much as we feared we would lose whatever little business we were getting after the lockdown was lifted.But now we will be forced to sell at a high price if there is poor supply, said a trader. C Udayshankar, secretary of the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Yeshwantpur, said that most of the retailers did not hike prices during the festival, but now costs are set to rise. Heavy rainfall and flooding in Maharashtra has damaged standing crops.So far, the onion coming from Maharashtra is old stock, and will not last long. The new stock will be moist and have more water content, making them difficult to store for long, he said. Last year too, consumers, farmers and traders had faced a similar situation, where onion quality had dipped and cost was high. Apart from Maharashtra, heavy rain and flooding in North Karnataka will also lead to a price escalation. The picture will be clear after a fortnight, when new stock starts coming in. The stock arriving from Maharashtra is of poor quality and there is no new produce from Karnataka so far, he added."
